It's great for businesses that prefer the familiarity of spreadsheets and want to track their projects in a similar way.\n\nBut, Airtable does have its limitations. Its structured views and spreadsheet format may not be suitable for scaling your company, and it doesn't offer as many features as some other options available in the market.\n\n# Why Consider an Alternative to Airtable?\n\n1. **Task Management Features:** While Airtable allows you to create a spreadsheet grid for task assignment, it lacks built-in task management features. This means you'll have to manually edit the grid, which can become tedious, especially if you regularly assign tasks to your team.\n1. **Communication Features:** In today's remote work environment, effective communication and collaboration are crucial. Airtable's only collaboration option is through comments, which may be sufficient for basic feedback but falls short for complex discussions.\n1. **Workflow Automation Tools:** Workflow automation is an essential feature in project management tools. Unfortunately, Airtable lacks comprehensive automation capabilities.\n1. **Cost:** Airtable's pricing can be expensive, especially for larger teams. The Plus plan starts at $12 per month per user, meaning a team of 10 would cost $120 per month.\nFortunately, we have researched and found the best Airtable alternatives that address these limitations.\n\n# Top 10 Airtable alternatives in 2024\n\nLooking for alternatives to Airtable? You're in luck! We've compiled a list of top Airtable alternatives for 2024. If you feel limited by Airtable's features, it's important to find a solution that suits your business model and makes you comfortable.\n\n## 1.

While Airtable offers more flexibility in terms of customization, including formulas, pivot tables, and custom views, it can also have a steep learning curve.
