This versatile tool allows users to add notes, craft lists, create itineraries, check calendar events, and receive notifications on their Apple Watch.\n\n\nHowever, one drawback is the absence of a free version, and Android users will need to explore alternative options as Things 3 lacks compatibility with their operating system.\n\n\n**Key Features of Things 3:**\n\n\nGenerate interactive to-do lists.\n\n\nEmploy drag-and-drop functionality for [list management](https://affine.pro/blog/8-free-project-tracker-templates-work-management-2023).\n\n\nEnhance visibility with checklist headings.\n\n\nEfficiently search for crucial tasks across multiple lists.\n\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n\nThings 3 is available for a one-time cost of $9.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 8.

An added benefit is the ability to manage multiple calendars within a single app(Apple Calendar).\n\n\nHowever, a potential drawback lies in the visual complexity when dealing with multiple daily events.

Until this aspect is addressed, can Outlook alter your perspective?\n\n\n**Key Features of Microsoft Outlook:**\n\n\nEfficiently schedule tasks and events.\n\n\nCollaborate seamlessly with Microsoft 365 groups.\n\n\nEmploy filters and grouping functionalities for effective task management.\n\n\nAccess any Microsoft Office tool on the go.\n\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n\nOutlook is free for personal use, while additional features can be unlocked under the Microsoft 365 plan, starting at $6.99/user per month.\n\n\n### \n10. [ZenDay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobisysteme.tasks.adapter.gt&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)\n\n\n\n![AWqx9rPxj12yePucRx_UiCqjMXBb_yfjMRBq4IHrpsE=](/blobs/AWqx9rPxj12yePucRx_UiCqjMXBb_yfjMRBq4IHrpsE=)\n\n\nDoes ZenDay bring a touch of zen to your life?\n\n\nThis mobile app introduces a distinctive 3D display that dynamically scrolls as you tick off tasks on your to-do list.

The app's simple calendar provides quick overviews of all your tasks.\n\n\nHowever, it comes with a limitation in terms of integrations. Expect to navigate between apps, potentially leading to time wastage.\n\n\nIt seems like TickTick might allow time to tick away. ⏳\n\n\nFor a detailed comparison, explore Todoist vs. TickTick!\n\n\n**Key Features of TickTick:**\n\n\nVoice input for adding tasks.\n\n\nIncorporates a Pomodoro feature for enhanced productivity.\n\n\nVarious calendar views for easy tracking of weekly or daily tasks.\n\n\nStreamlined reminder settings for simplicity.\n\n\n**Pricing**: TickTick offers a free plan, and its paid plan is priced at $27.99/user per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 12.

It seems like a wishful thought for Evernote to extend its capabilities to keeping track of your finances too.\n\n\n**Key Features of Evernote:**\n\n\nCapability to store handwritten notes.\nIntegration with apps like Slack, Outlook, etc., for seamless collaboration.\nAbility to scribble notes and create list templates.\nOffline usability for added convenience.\n**Pricing:**\nEvernote offers a free plan, and its paid plan starts at $7.99/user per month.\n\n\n### 14.
