[Any.do](https://www.any.do/en)\n\n\n\n![bu_omCExa66S7XYXpS1sx3P47SjF4FBQ1PFMWZ4qJ7o=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/bu_omCExa66S7XYXpS1sx3P47SjF4FBQ1PFMWZ4qJ7o=)\n\n\nAny.do boasts an easily navigable interface, facilitating on-the-go creation of your [daily plan](https://affine.pro/blog/top-10-best-free-digital-planner-apps-2023). You can enhance your list with notes, attachments, and prioritize tasks using color-coded labels.\n\n\nHowever, its integration with other [daily planner apps](https://affine.pro/blog/top-10-best-free-digital-planner-apps-2023) is subpar, and the free version offers limited features. Let's explore the app's positive attributes – the \"Any do-good\" features.\n\n\n**Key Features of Any.do:**\n\n\nReceive location-based and recurring reminders.\n\n\nEstablish a family calendar for shared lists.\n\n\nUtilize the \"Moment\" feature to focus on daily tasks individually.\n\n\nSeamlessly sync data across all your devices.\n\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n\nAny.do offers a free version, while the paid plans start at $5.99 per month.\n\n\n### 7.

This versatile tool allows users to add notes, craft lists, create itineraries, check calendar events, and receive notifications on their Apple Watch.\n\n\nHowever, one drawback is the absence of a free version, and Android users will need to explore alternative options as Things 3 lacks compatibility with their operating system.\n\n\n**Key Features of Things 3:**\n\n\nGenerate interactive to-do lists.\n\n\nEmploy drag-and-drop functionality for [list management](https://affine.pro/blog/8-free-project-tracker-templates-work-management-2023).\n\n\nEnhance visibility with checklist headings.\n\n\nEfficiently search for crucial tasks across multiple lists.\n\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n\nThings 3 is available for a one-time cost of $9.99.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 8. [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r)\n\n\n\n![K2DaSM7yS5K3y_nwgqiuOfezF3bqCY2KD3-ghZfIqY8=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/K2DaSM7yS5K3y_nwgqiuOfezF3bqCY2KD3-ghZfIqY8=)\n\n\nPeople and teams alike use Google Calendar as their go-to calendar app.\n\n\nIt offers the flexibility to switch between various to-do list views and seamlessly syncs personal events from Gmail. An added benefit is the ability to manage multiple calendars within a single app(Apple Calendar).\n\n\nHowever, a potential drawback lies in the visual complexity when dealing with multiple daily events. The time-list format, while comprehensive, may require scrolling, making it challenging to grasp a quick overview of your entire schedule. Perhaps it's time to explore alternatives by searching for \"Google Calendar alternatives.\"\n\n\n**Key Features of Google Calendar:**\n\n\nEasily toggle between daily, weekly, and monthly views.\n\n\nEfficiently search for tasks.\n\n\nSet reminders and due dates for to-dos.\n\n\nConnect and sync seamlessly across all your devices.\n\n\nPricing:\n\n\nGoogle Calendar is available for free, with a paid plan starting at $5/user per month.\n\n\n### 9.

Until this aspect is addressed, can Outlook alter your perspective?\n\n\n**Key Features of Microsoft Outlook:**\n\n\nEfficiently schedule tasks and events.\n\n\nCollaborate seamlessly with Microsoft 365 groups.\n\n\nEmploy filters and grouping functionalities for effective task management.\n\n\nAccess any Microsoft Office tool on the go.\n\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n\nOutlook is free for personal use, while additional features can be unlocked under the Microsoft 365 plan, starting at $6.99/user per month.\n\n\n### \n10.

You have the flexibility to toggle between focusing on a single task or viewing the entire day's list at once.\n\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that ZenDay lacks support for multiple task list views.\n\n\n**Key Features of ZenDay:**\n\n\nTasks automatically scroll up in alignment with time.\n\n\nSynchronize multiple calendars seamlessly.\n\n\nPrioritize tasks through intuitive color-coding.\n\n\nUtilize the debrief feature for a comprehensive daily task overview.\n\n\n**Pricing: Free**\n\n\n### 11. [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/?language=en_US)\n\n\n\n![VDDaFdtGeiPPmPUdScZjgwPe_4pKhi73-rUCUD3iZAc=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/VDDaFdtGeiPPmPUdScZjgwPe_4pKhi73-rUCUD3iZAc=)\n\n\n\n\n\nTickTick stands out as an excellent student planner app, offering the ability to schedule tasks, set reminders, and create shareable lists. The app's simple calendar provides quick overviews of all your tasks.\n\n\nHowever, it comes with a limitation in terms of integrations. Expect to navigate between apps, potentially leading to time wastage.\n\n\nIt seems like TickTick might allow time to tick away. ⏳\n\n\nFor a detailed comparison, explore Todoist vs. TickTick!\n\n\n**Key Features of TickTick:**\n\n\nVoice input for adding tasks.\n\n\nIncorporates a Pomodoro feature for enhanced productivity.\n\n\nVarious calendar views for easy tracking of weekly or daily tasks.\n\n\nStreamlined reminder settings for simplicity.\n\n\n**Pricing**: TickTick offers a free plan, and its paid plan is priced at $27.99/user per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 12.

The platform includes a time tracker for monitoring tasks and online meetings schedule meetings efficiently.\n\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the app lacks the capability to attach documents and photos to your lists.\n\n\n**Key Features of nTask:**\n\n\nTeam checklists and recurring lists for efficient task management.\n\n\nSupport for the Kanban method to enhance workflow.\n\n\nTime tracker to boost productivity by monitoring tasks and online meetings.\n\n\nGantt charts for effective timeline management.\n\n\n**Pricing:** The paid plan starts at $2.99/user per month.\n\n\n### 13.

It seems like a wishful thought for Evernote to extend its capabilities to keeping track of your finances too.\n\n\n**Key Features of Evernote:**\n\n\nCapability to store handwritten notes.\nIntegration with apps like Slack, Outlook, etc., for seamless collaboration.\nAbility to scribble notes and create list templates.\nOffline usability for added convenience.\n**Pricing:**\nEvernote offers a free plan, and its paid plan starts at $7.99/user per month.\n\n\n### 14.
