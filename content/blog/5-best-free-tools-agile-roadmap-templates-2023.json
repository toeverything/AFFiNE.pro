So whether you're an entrepreneur striving for business growth or part of an organization aiming to reach new heights in 2024.\n\nNow let's explore some different types of roadmaps before we dive into creating one ourselves!\n\n## Different Types of Roadmaps\n\nRoadmaps come in various forms, each designed to serve a specific purpose and cater to different needs.
