By logging your daily activities and habits, you can gain valuable insights into your behaviors and patterns over time. This awareness allows you to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments.\n\n\n* Provide motivation and encouragement. Many apps use visual cues, such as charts or streak counters, that show your progress towards achieving your goals.\n\n\n* Offer convenience.
