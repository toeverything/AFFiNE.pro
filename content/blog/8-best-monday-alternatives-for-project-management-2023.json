While Monday.com has gained significant popularity as a [team-centric project management platform](https://affine.pro/blog/best-project-planning-tools-software-for-teams-2023), it's important to explore alternative options that may better suit your specific needs. That's why we've compiled data from over 6,000 G2 reviews to present you with the top Monday.com alternatives and competitors.\n\n\nWhether you're a student seeking an affordable note-taking and planning tool or a project manager in search of a group-based project management solution, there are exciting alternatives available.

Limited reporting capabilities: Monday.com's reporting features may fall short for those requiring in-depth analytics and reporting for their projects.\n\n\n1. Comment section challenges: As projects progress and user comments increase, the comment section can become cluttered and challenging to navigate effectively.\n\n\n1. Restricted project view: Users may find it difficult to see all project views simultaneously, which can limit their ability to monitor and track progress efficiently.\n\n\n1. Pricing complexity: Monday.com pricing is based on the number of seats, and for larger companies requiring multiple user access, costs can escalate quickly.\n\n\nWhile Monday.com has its pros and cons, it's essential to evaluate your team's specific needs and business model to determine if it's the right fit.
