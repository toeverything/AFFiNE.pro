Some new and exciting changes for both #AFFiNE and #BlockSuite are as follows:\n\n\n## From BlockSuite\n\n\n**BlockSuite is the open-source collaborative editor project that powers the AFFiNE knowledge base.**\n\n\nIf you have followed the [AFFiNE repository](https://github.com/toeverything/affine), you will find that most of the bugs related to the editing experience are fixed in the [BlockSuite repository](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite).\n\n\nThe GitHub address for BlockSuite is: [https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite)\n\n\nFor most issues, bugs, feature requests and PRs we reconmmend you to **continue to use AFFiNE as the main repository**. You can report issues (such as bugs and feature requests) via the following link: [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/issues/new/choose)\n\n\nAFFiNE team members will be responsible for moving BlockSuite-related bugs to the BlockSuite repository.\n\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n\nIn our team and users' continued effort to make AFFiNE the most reliable all-in-one knowledge base, fixing bugs is always our main concern.
