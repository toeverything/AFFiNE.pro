Experience a **transformed collection** feature that introduces manual **multi-page selection**, **rule-based filtering**, **supercharged navigation with Command+K**. Your workflow will never be the same.\n\n# **Easy as a folder, advanced as a filter --** **A** **Revitalized Collection**\n\nWe all became too used to the convenience of dragging and dropping files into folders, even though we once despised managing a mess of too many folders and complicated paths. Our collection aims to solve this problem. The redesigned collection undergoes a remarkable transformation, boasting enhancements encompassing the concurrent support for **manual multi-page selection** and the capability to incorporate articles into the collection through **predefined rules**. It further facilitates the **effortless removal of articles from the collection**, with rules that are now more accessible and user-friendly.\n\n### 1. Adding Pages Manually with Multi-Selection to Enhance Your Collections\n\nYou can add pages to a newly created collection by either manually selecting **multiple pages** or by **filtering articles based on your favourites or tags**, and then choosing to include them in the collection. Furthermore, you can conveniently **drag and drop** articles directly into the collection from the **All Pages**!\n\n\n![GnzjcLMlX97cFS_PaaMx-T-zrEKhNUdEPkdHEUe5Ik4=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/GnzjcLMlX97cFS_PaaMx-T-zrEKhNUdEPkdHEUe5Ik4=)\n\n\n\n### 2. Rule-Based Inclusion and Manual Page Addition\n\nYou have the option to **filter articles based on specific criteria**, and thereafter, all articles that meet those criteria will **be automatically included in the collection**. In addition, you can **manually add other pages** to the collection separately.\n\n\n![4yY36FoCCoBSO0pMzG050BmLgDLfouf5GgBU7qlcfC8=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/4yY36FoCCoBSO0pMzG050BmLgDLfouf5GgBU7qlcfC8=)\n\n\n\n### 3. Refine Your Collections with Manual Page Deletion\n\nOne of the powerful new features in AFFiNE 0.10.0's collection is the ability to **delete manually added pages within the collection**, offering greater flexibility. This feature empowers you to fine-tune and customize your collections, ensuring that only relevant content remains, resulting in a **more streamlined and tailored document management experience**.\n\n\n![9aj29UkN3QB-TGUXsuPG2mwAj31g2c9RnnaxuMdMJVI=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/9aj29UkN3QB-TGUXsuPG2mwAj31g2c9RnnaxuMdMJVI=)\n\n\n\n# **Command/Control+K: Your Enhanced AFFiNE Navigator for Files, Commends, Settings and Everything.**\n\nYour AFFiNE Superpower! With a simple keystroke, Cmd/Ctrl+K, this innovative feature is set to transform the way you **navigate and interact** within AFFiNE. Say goodbye to the era of cumbersome menus and time-consuming tasks! Cmd/Ctrl+K places **the potential for enhanced efficiency** and personalization right at your fingertips.\n\n### 1. Precision Command Search\n\nCmd/Ctrl+K streamlines your workflow by enabling you to **easily search for specific commands**, jump between pages and workspaces, customize page layouts and widths, and seamlessly create new pages and workspaces.\n\n\n![vKlAsdYJ8Aph47NvUXPTz4niUQYhTWcy6z7E5pfyJa8=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/vKlAsdYJ8Aph47NvUXPTz4niUQYhTWcy6z7E5pfyJa8=)\n\n\n\n### 2. Instant Highlighting and Effortless Content Navigation\n\nThe search results are i**ntelligently highlighted**, allowing you to quickly pinpoint and retrieve text content, with the ability to **directly navigate to the exact page** with a single click.\n\n\n![TxirwQXuHQWm4GC4WAWnBrc7SrtUH1vzjqx1uM3XKUo=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/TxirwQXuHQWm4GC4WAWnBrc7SrtUH1vzjqx1uM3XKUo=)\n\n\n\nAs we embark on Day 2 of our launch week, you've witnessed the evolution of AFFiNE 0.10.0, and the transformation of **document management** and **creative workflows**.
