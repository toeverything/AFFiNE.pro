Our latest release, AFFiNE 0.10.0, introduces a wealth of enhancements to elevate your whiteboard experience, including **support** for any image on whiteboards, transparent background images, **effortless element grouping**, and **refined** **presentation styles**.

In Edgeless mode, you can now seamlessly **insert frames and groups** directly onto the page, eliminating unnecessary steps and enhancing your creative workflow.

The auto-connect feature streamlines combining related elements without manual line drawing. In edgeless page mode, understanding element relationships is effortless. This **boosts efficiency** and promotes a seamless whiteboard experience, ensuring **an intuitive reading order**.\n\n\n![spfYo1qPD6HE9uAojVPEbfp0dFegMZwx1sGbGA-b_BU=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/spfYo1qPD6HE9uAojVPEbfp0dFegMZwx1sGbGA-b_BU=)\n\n# **Experience Whiteboard Freedom with Easy Element Grouping**\n\nEver felt the frustration of adjusting whiteboard elements one by one?

Synchronized Scaling and Dragging\n\nIn AFFiNE, **scaling and dragging are seamlessly synchronized**.
