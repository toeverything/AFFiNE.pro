  "md": "Welcome to Day 3 of our AFFiNE launch week, where we're dedicated to fueling your **creativity and innovation**. Our latest release, AFFiNE 0.10.0, introduces a wealth of enhancements to elevate your whiteboard experience, including **support** for any image on whiteboards, transparent background images, **effortless element grouping**, and **refined** **presentation styles**. These updates are carefully designed to enhance your presentation capabilities, ensuring your ideas shine with clarity and elegance. Whether you're organizing elements, maintaining seamless scaling, or refining visual styles, AFFiNE is your ticket to **transforming your presentations and elevating your creative potential**.\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Fully Merged Experience Between the** **Edgeless and Page Mode**\n\n\n### 1. **Accessing Edgeless Elements in Page Mode**\n\n\nAFFiNE 0.10.0 supports the **seamless** **integration of edgeless mode elements into a page** and provides an easy way to **navigate back to edgeless mode from the page**. In Edgeless mode, you can now seamlessly **insert frames and groups** directly onto the page, eliminating unnecessary steps and enhancing your creative workflow. Meanwhile, in Page mode, you can conveniently access **frames and groups via the slash menu**, allowing you to efficiently navigate and manage your content with ease.\n\n\n<video muted autoplay loop preload=\"auto\" playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/qFzfnF1J3F5plpRhrIFf7QttAzGll1Bh0Ar-DKtEkPA=\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n\n### 2. **Automatically connect the page blocks on the whiteboard**\n\n\nThe whiteboard now offers enhanced **logical organization**, simplifying the creation of an uncluttered structure. The auto-connect feature **streamlines the combination** of related blocks without manual line drawing. In edgeless page mode, understanding block **relationships** is effortless, and with seamless **block-to-block transitions**, your workflow remains smooth and uninterrupted.\n\n\n\n![spfYo1qPD6HE9uAojVPEbfp0dFegMZwx1sGbGA-b_BU=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/spfYo1qPD6HE9uAojVPEbfp0dFegMZwx1sGbGA-b_BU=)\n\n\n# **Experience Whiteboard Freedom with Easy Element Grouping**\n\n\nEver felt the frustration of adjusting whiteboard elements one by one? With AFFiNE 0.10.0, **say hello to simplicity and group your whiteboard elements with ease**! This update lets you swiftly organize scattered elements into neat groups, enhancing your ability to **move and edit them collectively**.\n\n\n### 1. Effortless Group Nesting\n\n\nMultiple smaller groups can be merged into a larger group, offering the flexibility to **move both individual elements and smaller groups within the composition**. This feature allows for a highly organized and customizable approach to your content arrangement.\n\n\n\n![ygPZvKWsqd_M4sewePxSaOrtkVsxvXSvqnUlcloABZY=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/ygPZvKWsqd_M4sewePxSaOrtkVsxvXSvqnUlcloABZY=)\n\n\n### 2. Synchronized Scaling and Dragging\n\n\nIn AFFiNE, **scaling and dragging are seamlessly synchronized**. When you move an individual element within a group, **the group's border and size adapt in real time** to accommodate the element's new position.
