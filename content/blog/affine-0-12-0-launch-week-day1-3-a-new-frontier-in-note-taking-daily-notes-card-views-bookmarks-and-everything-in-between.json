The introduction of these new filters significantly **enhances the flexibility of the \"All Pages\" view**, providing you with a more **efficient and user-friendly document management experience**. This makes document handling more intuitive and effective.\n\n\n<video muted autoplay loop preload=\"auto\" playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/BJJLwoqgJRyeD7ypRO_urHRXV-o_D9vsV-gQaTiz1pE=\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n\n# **Get Ready to Unlock New Levels of Productivity**\n\n\n\n![uO1ZB4KWJaUGczcj2ij-OuUOEy0qu6eGa08hzMPp6yk=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/uO1ZB4KWJaUGczcj2ij-OuUOEy0qu6eGa08hzMPp6yk=)\n\n\nAs we wrap up our AFFiNE 0.12.0 launch week, we want to extend our heartfelt appreciation for your interest and backing.
