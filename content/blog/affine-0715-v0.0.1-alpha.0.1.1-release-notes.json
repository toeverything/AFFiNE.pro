Here's our work in the last few days:\n\n\n* Fixed: Drag and drop function of Kanban can not be used;\n\n\n* Fixed: The default color of the Kanban status label is yellow;\n\n\n* Fixed: After modifying the content of a sub-Kanban in Kanban mode, the sub-Kanban will move up and down with the mouse.\n\n\nAFFiNE is currently in the early alpha stage with limited access and public early access will be available in the autumn of 2022.\n\n\nAFFiNE is an open-source project which can be viewed on Github: [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE#readme](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE#readme)\n\n\nIf you endorse this open source project, please help us by clicking the GitHub star, which is crucial for the future development of AFFiNE.\n\n\nAFFiNE is very grateful to all open source contributors and will work to build a more positive open source ecosystem.\n\n\nHope you have a nice time with AFFiNE!\n\n\n",
