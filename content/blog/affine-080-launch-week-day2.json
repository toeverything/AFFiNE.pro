Get ready to unlock new levels of productivity and immerse yourself in a seamless and efficient workflow.\n\n**Join us as an early access sponsor for the AFFiNE Cloud, and unlock advanced collaboration capabilities while upholding the local-first nature of your data.**\n\n**Support Us:** https://community.affine.pro/checkout/affine-cloud-early-supporter\n\n\n\n## **Extend the Boundary of Blocks with the Attached Files**\n\n\n\n### **① Embed, Save & Preview. Attachment (file) Block - Enrich Your Digital Creations**\n\nWhen you're making something and want to include extra files to go along with it, simply grab the file and drop it wherever you want. After that, you can change its name, put in a caption, and make copies if you need to. It's easy and flexible!\n\n\n![tI4iu0tidlTwrhi-zO3LDIU5hX_W7G3rFuB9xDxTUks=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/tI4iu0tidlTwrhi-zO3LDIU5hX_W7G3rFuB9xDxTUks=)\n\n# \n\n## **Enhanced Accessibility on Editable Blocks**\n\n### \n\n### **① Grammarly Support - Enhance Your Writing Experience**\n\nOur collaborative never-wrong undo-redo ability with Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) can now seamlessly collaborate with third-party editing. For example, grammarly can now seamlessly work with AFFiNE without worrying about the messing up the docs text. Now, as you type, Grammarly will automatically check your text in real-time, ensuring that your writing is polished and error-free.\n\nFriendly Reminder: To access this feature, please download Grammarly for Desktop first. Once installed, you can enjoy its benefits to the fullest. Of course, you can have a try on other formatting or automation tools similarly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![9bzGBstt4mdlBTSp8b15WnG5vZ7hkES4IZHZE7LyVrQ=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/9bzGBstt4mdlBTSp8b15WnG5vZ7hkES4IZHZE7LyVrQ=)\n\n\n\n### **② Text highlight - Make Important Things Stand Out Even More**\n\nIn our ongoing efforts to enhance your experience in page mode, we are excited to introduce a new feature: Text Highlight.
