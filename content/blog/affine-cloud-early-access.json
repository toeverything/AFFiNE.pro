At AFFiNE Cloud, we've crafted a robust permission system that empowers document owners to dictate edit and view rights. This level of granularity guarantees that sensitive information remains confidential while facilitating collaboration.\n\n### ③ **Unleash Creativity with Collaborative Edgeless Mode**\n\nWe understand that collaboration is a widespread concept, and many applications provide this functionality. Wait, doesn't the idea of being confined to document-based collaboration sometimes feel a bit boring?\n\nWell, at AFFiNE Cloud, it's time to break free from boring stuff and reimagined collaboration beyond the confines of traditional document modes: collaborative whiteboarding - where you can leverage pens, shapes, images and connectors to collaborate with others on a canvas as limitless as your imagination.\n\n\n![jjKkV-ai7hORH_aVcXIsd_GGYmLYifhYodvCBZDBDJY=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/jjKkV-ai7hORH_aVcXIsd_GGYmLYifhYodvCBZDBDJY=.webp)\n\n### ④ **Single Page Sharing - Precision Collaboration Made Simple**\n\nYes, we know sharing a specific page without divulging the entirety of your workspace matters a lot to users, so we make it happen.\n\nHere in AFFiNE, no longer will you need to expose unrelated pages – focus on precision collaboration, sharing only what's necessary while keeping the rest securely tucked away.\n\n\n![Jm2FmncnepN67lM_0VnXic6k6NIcH2VGgnvB8S3lwU0=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/Jm2FmncnepN67lM_0VnXic6k6NIcH2VGgnvB8S3lwU0=.webp)\n\n## 2) Sponsor us for Early Access to AFFiNE Cloud\n\nWe firmly believe that innovation goes beyond surface appeal, it's about redefining collaboration itself and authentically bringing value to users.
