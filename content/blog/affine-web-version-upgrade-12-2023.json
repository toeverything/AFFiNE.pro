Make sure you understand the changes to ensure you keep your data safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n**We always recommend you use the latest [AFFiNE Client](https://affine.pro/download) and activate AFFiNE Cloud.**\n\n\n\n\n\n### What is happening?\n\n\nWe are upgrading [app.affine.pro](https://app.affine.pro) to use the latest version of AFFiNE. At the time of publishing this article, the [app.affine.pro](https://app.affine.pro) web app uses an old version of AFFiNE Cloud which is no longer supported. We will upgrade this web version and retire the old version - along with the old data. These changes are planned for December 14th - 15th (Singapore Standard Time).\n\n\n\n\n\n### What do I need to do?\n\n\n\n\n\n#### If you have ever used [app.affine.pro](https://app.affine.pro)\n\n\n* Head over to [app.affine.pro](https://app.affine.pro) and backup all your data - local and cloud workspaces\n\n\n* All local data will be completely lost after the upgrade\n\n\n* We will keep a temporary copy of AFFiNE Cloud data on [archive.affine.pro](https://archive.affine.pro) (live from next week for a limited period)\n\n\n#### If you are using [insider.affine.pro](https://insider.affine.pro)\n\n\n* Your AFFiNE Cloud data will be accessible on the new [app.affine.pro](https://app.affine.pro) version after it is updated\n\n\n* You will lose access to any local storage data - we advise you to download the [AFFiNE Client](https://affine.pro/download) and activate AFFiNE Cloud\n\n\n#### If you are using the [AFFiNE Client](https://affine.pro/download)\n\n\n* There's no action you need to take\n\n\n\n\n\n### More questions?\n\n\nIf you still have questions or concerns please do email us: [support@toeverything.info](mailto:support@toeverything.info)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
