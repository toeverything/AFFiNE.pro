Come and say a warm welcome to the AFFiNE team over on our new AFFiNE YouTube channel.\n\ncreated: 2023-03-10\n\nupdated: 2023-03-10\n\nlayout: blog\n\npublish: true\n\n---\n\n\n![YS0AkQEnUYfo0gPFGdz19YlmZpZdmA8SbtFGNqIrcBE=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/YS0AkQEnUYfo0gPFGdz19YlmZpZdmA8SbtFGNqIrcBE=)\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of our brand-new [AFFiNE - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@affinepro)! Our channel aims to bring you closer to our product, and help you get the most out of AFFiNE. So whether that's showcasing the latest updates, offering tips and tricks, or offering in-depth discussions, we are excited for the opportunities this brings.\n\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\n<iframe style=\"border-radius: 15px;\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kq1ibp0DmR4\" title=\"AFFiNE Downhills Launch Event\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\nOur community has shown keen interest in knowing more about what goes on under the hood, and so we want to open everything up to truly embrace the concept of **building in public**. So that was our decision to try this - something _new_, something _different_, but also something _exciting_. And so, as part of our launch on YouTube, we have put something special together for our first upload.\n\nIn our first video, we introduce AFFiNE, who we are, our **philosophy**, our **goals**, and various team members. Focusing on our latest release of AFFiNE, `Downhills` , we give you a deep dive into AFFiNE. We explore the **features** and **functionality** while covering the product **architecture**, **product design**, **user interface**, **user experience**, offer **technical overviews** and discuss our **operations**.\n\n**Open source**, **privacy focused**, and **local-first** - these are our commitments, and that's why we believe that being open and transparent with our communication and what we are doing is key to building a strong, meaningful relationship with our community. We are committed to keeping you informed every step of the way.\n\nWe're excited to use YouTube as a platform to not only share our journey, but to empower our users in experiencing the full benefits of AFFiNE. No matter if your interest in AFFiNE is as a **general user** or a **developer**. We hope that this channel can still provide you with interesting and useful resources. So, if you are looking forward to specific types of content, let us know - whether that be _release note videos_, in-depth _feature discussions_, _technical discussions_ or something else.\n\nSo please head over to our new channel and show some support - don't forget to **subscribe** and hit the notification bell to stay up-to-date with all of our videos and new uploads. Thank you everyone for your continued to suppport and look forward to bringing you closer to the AFFiNE.\n\n## Contact Us\n\n* AFFiNE Community: [https://community.affine.pro](https://community.affine.pro)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE)\n* **YouTube: [https://youtube.com/@affinepro](https://youtube.com/@affinepro)**\n* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/AffineOfficial](https://twitter.com/AffineOfficial)\n* Discord: [https://discord.gg/Arn7TqJBvG](https://discord.gg/Arn7TqJBvG)\n* Telegram: [https://t.me/affineworkos](https://t.me/affineworkos)\n* Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Affine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affine)\n* Medium: [https://medium.com/@affineworkos](https://medium.com/@affineworkos)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
