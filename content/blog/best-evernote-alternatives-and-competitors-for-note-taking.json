Evernote has been in the news a lot, with their recent price hikes and allegedly laying off almost all of their existing workforce. It’s no wonder that more and more people are taking the time to explore [Evernote alternatives](https://affine.pro/blog/top-10-Evernote-Alternatives), so let’s go through some of the competitors to Evernote along with their own advantages and disadvantages, and understand the selection criteria for identifying the best alternatives Evernote has to offer.\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/kJ2oIcYeq7nJ80PC3swg19iJXW0WN0xNNcDkk5zOD8c=\"\n  alt=\"Evernote free\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\n## What is Evernote note taking App?\n\n\nFirst launched in 2008, Evernote gained a significant user base as a popular note-taking and organisation application that allows users to create, capture, and manage various types of information.\n\n\nUsers can create individual Evernote notes within the app, which can contain text, formatted content, and multimedia attachments. Then your notes can be organised into notebooks and tagged for easy categorisation and retrieval. Which is made even easier, as Evernote enables users to access their notes across different devices and platforms – from desktop to mobile.\n\n\n## Reasons to look for an [Evernote Alternative](https://affine.pro/blog/top-10-Evernote-Alternatives)\n\n\n### 1) Pricing, Free Version, and Subscription Model\n\n\nEvernote offers both free and premium subscription plans. The free plan has limitations on features and storage capacity, while the premium plan comes with a monthly or annual fee. If you find the pricing structure of Evernote to be restrictive or if you’re looking for a more budget-friendly option, exploring alternatives can be beneficial. There are several note-taking applications available that offer competitive features at a lower cost or even for free.\n\n\n### 2) Real-time Collaboration\n\n\nWant to share notes and collaborate with teams? That’s made a little difficult with Evernote, as there is no real-time collaboration offering. As technology and the web grows, the idea of multiplayer and real-time interactions becomes not only increasingly more common but almost even a necessity.\n\n\n### 3) Lack of Productivity Features\n\n\nOne of the significant drawbacks of Evernote is its lack of productivity features. While it excels in note-taking, it falls short in providing tools to help users manage their tasks, projects, and time effectively. This limitation can lead to users relying on multiple apps to get things done, which can be cumbersome and inefficient. In contrast, many [Evernote alternatives](https://affine.pro/blog/top-10-Evernote-Alternatives) offer robust productivity features, such as task management, project planning, and calendar integration, making them a more comprehensive solution for users.\n\n\n### 4) Evernote Security Issues\n\n\nEvernote has faced several security concerns in the past, including data breaches and vulnerabilities in its encryption methods. While the company has taken steps to address these issues, some users may still be hesitant to trust their sensitive information to the platform. In contrast, many [Evernote alternatives](https://affine.pro/blog/top-10-Evernote-Alternatives) prioritize security and offer advanced features such as end-to-end encryption, two-factor authentication, and secure data storage. For users who value their data’s security, these alternatives may be a more attractive option.\n\n\n### 5) Migration from Evernote\n\n\nAnother crucial aspect to consider when migrating from Evernote is the organization of your notes. Evernote’s notebook and tag system can be complex, and users may need to reorganize their notes to fit the new app’s structure. However, many [Evernote alternatives](https://affine.pro/blog/top-10-Evernote-Alternatives) offer flexible organization systems that allow users to customize their note structure. By taking the time to reorganize your notes, you can ensure that they are easily accessible and usable in your new app.\n\n\nSo you might not think a lack of features would be a problem, the main things this show is rather it’s not about the features you have but rather the features your audience and users want. It’s important to have useful features for your users.\n\n\n## The best Evernote Alternatives for 2024\n\n\n### 1) AFFiNE\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/qsk5CeSlOqBvX5OZXaVZzPjLRa6Ktz6-e6MiQawgmVk=\"\n  alt=\"AFFiNE- evernote alternative\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\n[AFFiNE](https://affine.pro) is an interesting app because it caters to so many possible users and use cases. This all-in-one KnowledgeOS combines the likes of Notion and Monday to offer you a unified web app where you can write, draw, and plan all at once. On top of that AFFiNE is open-source which means that AFFiNE and its code will always be available in some form – so your data will always be available to you!\n\n\n#### Advantages\n\n\n* Free and opensource: No other software on this list can claim to be free and open-source. This enables users to wield a powerful productivity app without cost, but also gives them the power to control their note taking experience. Developers can integrate and make improvements to AFFiNE directly, which makes this a very powerful solution that can continue to grow.\n\n\n* Multi-platform support: Starting out as a web-based app AFFiNE offers support across modern desktop systems. And with that comes a consistent experience with tailored platform features, such as styling, which create a more native experience. And with mobile support coming down the line, practically every device can be supported by this note-taking tool.\n\n\n* Real-time collaboration and easy syncing: With real-time collaboration AFFiNE allows multiple users to edit a document at the same moment, with real-time updates. And no matter you work offline/online or on various devices your data and changes sync easily and trouble free. No conflicts and clashes to deal with - just easy simple syncing where we do all the heavy lifting.\n\n\n* Community and build in public: There are lots of communities that follow different projects and can help support different apps. With AFFiNE it's less about building a community solely with the purpose of supporting AFFiNE - but rather to grow  open-source communities, developer communities, productivity communities and more. You can engage and interact with lots of great and interesting people - while also being able to feedback on the application and directly impact the future development - from brand new feature requests to improvements.\n\n\n* Actively developed: Many apps just work but that's it. They don't offer more features or continue to develop the project or software further. AFFiNE is different With lots of future enhancements that will continue to strengthen AFFiNE as an all-in-one solution you can be confident that AFFiNE will always be a next-gen solution that continues to shape with cutting-edge approaches and user requirements.\n\n\n#### Disadvantages\n\n\nAFFiNE is feature-rich but there still may be some features that users might be looking for which have not been added (yet). This can be overcome with the vast community support and the growing plugin community to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2) Google Keep\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/uTY57PujmoqVr4JPS2b9y787eBVZsBSxfHzs_x0YmrI=\"\n  alt=\"any free replacement for evernote\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nGoogle Keep is another free note-taking application. It's pretty basic, but it's an excellent option for those who prefer a clean, straightforward note-taking experience. Google Keep integrates with other Google apps like Gmail and Calendar, making it easy to access your notes quickly.\n\n\n#### Advantages\n\n\n* Seamless Integration with Google Ecosystem: Google Keep integrates seamlessly with other Google services and applications, such as Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Calendar. This integration allows for easy sharing, syncing, and collaboration across multiple devices and platforms. If you already use Google services extensively, Google Keep provides a cohesive note-taking experience within the Google ecosystem.\n\n\n* Simplicity and Ease of Use: Google Keep offers a straightforward and intuitive interface that makes note-taking quick and effortless. The app focuses on simplicity, allowing users to create and organise notes with ease.

This versatility allows users to capture and store different types of content within their notes. Additionally, Google Keep offers visual organisation through color-coded notes and labels, making it easy to categorise and locate specific information.\n\n\n* Reminders and Location-Based Notes: One notable feature of Google Keep is its reminder functionality. Users can set reminders for individual notes, ensuring important tasks and events are not forgotten. Moreover, Google Keep allows users to create location-based notes, which can be particularly useful for location-specific reminders or capturing ideas when visiting certain places.\n\n\n* Cross-Platform Availability: Google Keep is accessible across various platforms, including the web, Android, and iOS devices. This cross-platform availability ensures that your notes are synced and accessible from any device with an internet connection. The synchronisation is seamless, allowing for real-time updates and easy switching between devices.\n\n\n#### Disadvantages\n\n\nWhile Google Keep offers a lightweight and streamlined note-taking experience, it may lack some of the advanced features and organisation capabilities found in Evernote. If you require extensive organisation, tagging, or advanced search functionalities, Evernote might be a better fit. However, for users seeking a simple, intuitive, and integrated note-taking solution within the Google ecosystem, Google Keep provides a compelling alternative.\n\n\n### 3) Microsoft OneNote\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/qGOpD8eOKisSo7f4l0n8piu1TMH_GCTrZerU9m-7YPU=\"\n  alt=\"evernote vs onenote\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\n[OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) is a note-taking application by Microsoft that's included in the Microsoft Office suite. While it doesn't have as many features as Evernote, it's entirely free, and it's an excellent option for those who only need basic note-taking features. OneNote seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft products like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, making it easy to work across different platforms.\n\n\n#### Advantages\n\n\n* Integration with Microsoft Office Suite: OneNote seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. This integration allows for easy sharing, importing, and exporting of content across different Microsoft platforms. If you frequently use Microsoft Office tools, OneNote provides a cohesive note-taking experience within the Microsoft ecosystem.\n\n\n* Hierarchical Organisation and Note Structure: OneNote offers a hierarchical structure for organising notes, allowing you to create notebooks, sections, and pages within a logical hierarchy. This structure makes it easy to categorise and navigate through your notes, ensuring efficient organisation and retrieval of information.\n\n\n* Rich Formatting and Media Support: OneNote provides a wide range of formatting options to enhance your notes.

OneNote's powerful handwriting recognition capabilities convert your handwritten notes into searchable text, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.\n\n\n* Collaboration and Syncing: OneNote offers robust collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on the same notebooks simultaneously.

OneNote also provides reliable syncing across devices, ensuring that your notes are always up to date and accessible from anywhere.\n\n\n#### Disadvantages\n\n\nWhile OneNote offers a powerful and versatile note-taking experience, it may have a steeper learning curve compared to some others due to its extensive feature set. Additionally, some advanced features in OneNote, such as version history and advanced search capabilities, may require a Microsoft 365 subscription. However, for users seeking a robust and integrated note-taking solution, particularly within the Microsoft ecosystem, OneNote provides a compelling alternative to Everenote.\n\n\n### 4) Bear\n\n\n\n![AFyjrz6CDu0mWXkyilJ4PCBhYEMro4R0kNU0KqgZIIw=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/AFyjrz6CDu0mWXkyilJ4PCBhYEMro4R0kNU0KqgZIIw=)\n\n\n[Bear](https://www.bear.app.com) is the perfect option for those who prefer a minimalist interface. This note-taking app is only available on Apple devices, but it's well worth checking out if you're an iOS user.

For example, Bear has a smaller storage limit in its free version, and it may not have the same level of advanced features or integrations as Evernote. However, for users who value simplicity, a clean interface, Markdown support, and a focus on core note-taking functionality, Bear can be a compelling alternative to Evernote. And of course don't forget the iOS exclusivity.\n\n\n## 5) Notion\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/eYLeYxhsRgRqga-XQ9masnD5QOeKVeov0aQ2LrQABZs=\"\n  alt=\"onenote alternative\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\n[Notion](https://www.notion.so) is a versatile and highly customisable note-taking and productivity app that caters to individuals and teams alike.
