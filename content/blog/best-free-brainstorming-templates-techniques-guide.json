This collaborative approach fosters innovation by building on existing [concepts](https://affine.pro/blog/concept-maps-definition-features-benefits-examples).\n\n\n* **Divergent Thinking:** This technique encourages wild and imaginative ideas without restrictions, pushing the boundaries of conventional thinking and uncovering new possibilities during brainstorming sessions.\n\n\n* **Incorporating Visual Aids:** This is where brainstorming templates weigh in. Tools such as mind maps and mood boards stimulate creativity by helping individuals visualize their thoughts tangibly. These aids assist in organizing ideas spatially and making connections between different elements.\n\n\n* **Time Management:** A significant aspect of effective brainstorming, setting specific time limits for ideation exercises maintains focus, promotes urgency, and prevents prolonged discussions on a single idea.
