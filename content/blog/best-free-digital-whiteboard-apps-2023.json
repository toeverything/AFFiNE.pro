The inability to collaborate and visually present your ideas becomes a source of frustration. Suddenly, you reminisce about the old-school whiteboards you used in the past, covered in sticky notes and magnets, where you had the freedom to draw and describe freely. However, even though those whiteboards offered more flexibility, they still couldn't meet your needs for collaboration and convenience. **The limited boundaries and the constant erasing of incorrect content made them unattractive and impractical.**\n\n**This is where modern whiteboard tools come into play**. There are now various whiteboard tools available in the market, but which one is the best?

Whether it's sketching diagrams, illustrating workflows, or mapping out strategies, a whiteboard provides a clear and easily understandable visual medium.\n1. Idea Generation and Exploration: The spaciousness of a whiteboard encourages free thinking and exploration of ideas. It serves as a canvas where concepts can be brainstormed, expanded upon, and refined in real-time, fostering creativity and innovation.\n1.

They facilitate group discussions, allowing team members to contribute, build upon each other's ideas, and collectively solve problems.
