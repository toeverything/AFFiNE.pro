The inability to collaborate and visually present your ideas becomes a source of frustration. Suddenly, you reminisce about the old-school free online whiteboard you used in the past, covered in sticky notes and magnets, where you had the freedom to draw and describe freely.\n\nHowever, even though those online whiteboards offered more flexibility, they still couldn't meet your needs for collaboration and convenience. **The limited boundaries and the constant erasing of incorrect content made them unattractive and impractical.**\n\n**This is where modern whiteboard tools come into play**. There are now various digital whiteboards available in the market, but which one is the best? Which one is truly worth using?\n\nThis article will guide you through the selection process, helping you find the perfect free whiteboard app for your needs.
