Find the perfect fit for your team's collaboration and organization needs.\"\n\ncreated: 2023-09-05\n\nupdated: 2023-09-05\n\nlayout: blog\n\npublish: true\n\n---\n\nTrello has established itself as one of the user-friendly Kanban tools since its inception in 2011. Even after more than ten years, Trello remains a prominent choice for Kanban software. However, many users are impeded by its restricted functionality and reporting capabilities. Teams seek better alternatives for enhanced productivity.\n\nTherefore, this article aims to familiarize you with Trello's functionalities and also present its top 10 alternatives. Let's begin this journey of exploration!\n\n# **What is Trello?**\n\n\n![BK1eSsRQGc8-hu3kQAhzFPutp7Lik94JT6RU76q_RHs=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/BK1eSsRQGc8-hu3kQAhzFPutp7Lik94JT6RU76q_RHs=)\n\nTrello, developed by Atlassian, serves as a project management solution built upon the principles of the Kanban framework. It excels in overseeing tasks through a user-friendly to-do list layout. Facilitating the exchange of boards and cards among individuals or groups, Trello comes with both a complimentary package and premium options. The upgraded versions provide enhanced automation, collaborative capabilities, and increased administrative authority.\n\n# **Pros and Cons:**\n\n\n![wRZ4uEifgIz5kFGV30kbcKD8P87OjQKrqUcCgCJIoKM=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/wRZ4uEifgIz5kFGV30kbcKD8P87OjQKrqUcCgCJIoKM=)\n\n## Pros:\n\n**Kanban Framework**: Trello's implementation of the Kanban methodology provides a simple and effective way to manage tasks and workflows, particularly for smaller projects and teams.\n\n**Flexibility**: Its flexible card and board structure allows users to customize their workflow, adapting Trello to various project types and work processes.\n\n**Collaboration**: Trello enables smooth collaboration through shared boards, cards, and real-time updates, fostering teamwork and communication within projects.\n\n## Cons:\n\n**Limited Complexity**: Trello's simplicity can be a limitation for more complex projects or larger teams that require advanced features and customization options.\n\n**Lack of Advanced Reporting**: Trello's reporting capabilities are relatively basic, lacking in-depth analytics and advanced reporting features needed for comprehensive project analysis.\n\n**Restricted Free Offering**: While Trello provides a free plan, its capabilities are notably limited. Key features like Calendar, Timeline, Map, Table, and Dashboard Views are inaccessible. Sole reliance on the Kanban board can be problematic when different teams need diverse layouts. Consider alternatives with a strong free plan offering varied viewing options.\n\n# **What is a Good Project Management Tool for Kanban?**\n\nA proficient project management tool for Kanban should effectively fulfil the fundamental principles of the Kanban system, encompassing the visualization of work, constraining work-in-progress, and optimizing overall flow and efficiency.
