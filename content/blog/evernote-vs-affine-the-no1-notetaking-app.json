Two popular options are Evernote and AFFiNE. In this article, we'll compare Evernote and AFFiNE to help you decide which app is the best fit for your notetaking needs.\n\n\n## AFFiNE\n\n\nAFFiNE is a next-generation knowledge base that serves as an open source, privacy-focused, local-first alternative to Notion. With AFFiNE, you can create workspaces and docs in plain text, Markdown, and blocks, including text, headings, images, databases, to-do lists, and numbered lists. AFFiNE offers seamless switching between Paper and Edgeless modes, empowering your workspace with powerful benefits such as online synchronization, multiplayer collaboration, and the ability to share your workspaces online with others. AFFiNE's flexibility and customizability make it a great choice for teams looking to streamline their workflow and collaboration.\n\n\n## Evernote\n\n\nEvernote is a popular notetaking app that offers a wide range of features, including note organization, search functionality, and the ability to clip web content. Evernote's interface is user-friendly, and it offers a wide range of integrations with other apps and services. Evernote also offers mobile apps and offline access, making it easy to stay organized and productive on the go.\n\n\n## Comparison\n\n\nWhen it comes to features, both AFFiNE and Evernote offer a lot of tools and customization options. However, there are some key differences between the two apps.\n\n\nOne of the biggest differences is that AFFiNE is a local-first app, while Evernote is a cloud-based app. This means that AFFiNE stores your data locally on your device, while Evernote stores your data in the cloud. This can be an important consideration for users who prioritize privacy and security.\n\n\nAnother key difference is that AFFiNE offers a truly freeform canvas in Edgeless mode, while Evernote offers a more structured approach. This can make AFFiNE a better choice for users who want a more creative and flexible workspace.\n\n\nIn terms of collaboration, both apps offer multiplayer collaboration, but AFFiNE's local-first approach means that users can collaborate offline without an internet connection.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nIn conclusion, both Evernote and AFFiNE are great notetaking apps, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. Evernote offers a user-friendly and cloud-based approach, making it a great choice for users who need a powerful and flexible notetaking app. On the other hand, AFFiNE offers a local-first and highly customizable platform, making it a great choice for users who prioritize privacy, flexibility, and creativity. Ultimately, the choice between Evernote and AFFiNE will depend on your specific needs and preferences.\n\n\n",
