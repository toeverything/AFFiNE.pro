It's a goal-setting framework that helps businesses align their goals with their strategy and measure progress towards achieving them. OKRs have become increasingly popular in recent years, with companies such as Google, LinkedIn, and Airbnb using them to drive their success.\n\n\nIf you're looking to implement OKRs in your business, you might be wondering where to start. That's where our Notion alternative comes in. Our product is designed to help businesses set up and track their OKRs in a simple and intuitive way.\n\n\nIn this article, we'll cover everything you need to know about OKRs, from what they are and how they differ from KPIs, to how to set them up effectively. We'll also show you how our product can help you achieve your goals with OKRs.\n\n\n### **What are OKRs?**\n\n\n\n![OayUDx3S8wG-FNMSk2cz8gZCvyIUa5oZlkUgzhDiX9Q=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/OayUDx3S8wG-FNMSk2cz8gZCvyIUa5oZlkUgzhDiX9Q=)\n\n\nOKRs are a goal-setting framework that helps businesses align their goals with their strategy and measure progress towards achieving them. The framework consists of two parts: objectives and key results.\n\n\nObjectives are the goals that you want to achieve. They should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Objectives should also be ambitious and inspire your team to achieve great things.\n\n\nKey results are the specific, measurable outcomes that will help you achieve your objectives. They should be quantifiable and provide a clear indication of progress towards your objectives.\n\n\nOne of the key differences between OKRs and KPIs is that KPIs focus on measuring performance, while OKRs focus on achieving specific goals. KPIs are typically used to track ongoing performance metrics, such as revenue or customer satisfaction. OKRs, on the other hand, are used to set specific goals and measure progress towards achieving them.\n\n\nOKRs can be used by businesses of all sizes and types. For example, a sales team might use OKRs to increase their revenue by a certain percentage, while a marketing team might use them to increase their website traffic or social media engagement.\n\n\n### **How to set up OKRs?**\n\n\n\n![RY1DVsMxwXjfY0FclXyYKwXNs_Mj9lYTMW-8j1vSCIw=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/RY1DVsMxwXjfY0FclXyYKwXNs_Mj9lYTMW-8j1vSCIw=)\n\n\nSetting up OKRs involves several steps:\n\n\n1. **Define your overall business objectives:** Start by identifying your top-level business objectives. These should be aligned with your company's mission and vision.\n\n\n1. **Break down your objectives:** Once you have your overall business objectives in place, break them down into departmental or team objectives. These should be aligned with your overall business objectives.\n\n\n1. **Define your key results:** For each objective, identify the key results that will help you achieve it. These should be specific, measurable, and time-bound.\n\n\n1. **Assign ownership:** Assign an owner to each objective and key result. This person will be responsible for ensuring that the objective is achieved and the key results are met.\n\n\n1. **Monitor progress:** Regularly monitor progress towards achieving your objectives and key results. This will help you identify any issues or obstacles and make adjustments as needed.\n\n\nWhen setting up OKRs, it's important to keep them simple, focused, and aligned with your overall business strategy. Our Notion alternative can help you set up your OKRs quickly and easily, and monitor progress towards achieving them.\n\n\n### **How to implement OKRs?**\n\n\n\n![SrjDPeDPd1p1414MWce14uw5XL218BmFpV0gvIPErPA=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/SrjDPeDPd1p1414MWce14uw5XL218BmFpV0gvIPErPA=)\n\n\nImplementing OKRs effectively involves more than just setting them up.
