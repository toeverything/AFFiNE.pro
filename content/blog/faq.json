Nonetheless, within our product development team, ongoing discussions are underway to explore additional enhancements for refining data structuring. We are planning to introduce incremental updates in the near future to implement these improvements. If you wish to create a subpage structure similar to the one illustrated, it can be achieved through the use of link pages.\n\n\n\n![XJmrzXxgMttiu9D-iaFtN-laWvaAI556Q8B67BCz04k=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/XJmrzXxgMttiu9D-iaFtN-laWvaAI556Q8B67BCz04k=)\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Q: Is there an option for toggle/outline lists?**\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, the requested feature is not available at present. We appreciate its importance, but it is not yet available in the stable version. We request your patience as we work towards including it in future updates. The upcoming toggle will look like this:\n\n\n\n![G2dLnklDsKZEh91ReWWsV7X-xi9hwXxPB4VXrshTWTI=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/G2dLnklDsKZEh91ReWWsV7X-xi9hwXxPB4VXrshTWTI=)\n\n\n### **Q: How can I delete multiple rows in the database?**\n\n\nA: To delete multiple rows in the database, **drag and drop the rows** you want to remove, then press '**ESC**' followed by '**Backspace**' to complete the deletion process efficiently.\n\n\n<video muted autoplay loop preload=\"auto\" playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/EAgJZmWomW4wSwiTABfDyxli6zld91Mp623L3uWspqk=\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n\n### **Q: Can I input text inside a shape?**\n\n\nA: Sure!

You can log in to AFFiNE with this email. Additionally, you have the option to sign in using your Google account.\n\n\n1. **Create Your Cloud Workspace**: You can create a local workspace and then enable it to a cloud workspace.\n\n\n  \n![VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/VA1BZmj4j3uVgfM0lQYXoXYJRvYO89bsa01FpwHpgZg=)\n\n\n1. **Invite your collaborators**: You can add user emails to the workspace and invite collaborators to work together.\n\n\n  \n![RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/RFCrZzO0MCUusua-HEbCIbizQamQjtJpskDCRsLL8Kw=)\n\n\n**Detailed Guidelines**: For more detailed instructions or information about the new features or changes in the service, you can refer to the provided link: [https://affine.pro/blog/what-is-new-affine-0922](https://affine.pro/blog/what-is-new-affine-0922)\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Q: I have invited my collaborator, but why can't users join my cloud workspace?**\n\n\nA: Currently, Cloud has opened up free access to all users, allowing **Free** users of cloud workspace to have up to **3 collaborators**. **Pro users**, on the other hand, will see an increase in the number of **collaborators to 10 seats**. If you encounter any issues while inviting collaborators, please reach out to us at [https://community.affine.pro/home](https://community.affine.pro/home).\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Q: Isn't the Docker image meant for self-hosting?**\n\n\nA: The Docker image is primarily designed for self-hosting, enabling users to run it on their own servers. Nevertheless, it is built to provide flexibility. Users have the option to configure it to integrate with cloud services if they find it necessary, depending on their specific needs.\n\n\nOur server image aims at high scalability. It can be started in stand-alone mode without relying on any cloud service, or as a node in a cluster service. Therefore, the server contains the necessary cloud service components. Please refer to our self-hosting guide configures related components: [Self-host AFFiNE](https://docs.affine.pro/docs/self-host-affine).\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Q: Is the underlying collaboration technology shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions?**\n\n\nA: Yes, the underlying collaboration technology is shared between self-hosting and cloud-based solutions. This ensures consistency in features and functionality across different deployment options. Please note that while local peer-to-peer (P2P) collaboration features may not have been developed yet, the core collaboration technology remains consistent across all deployment methods. We anticipate these improvements to be rolled out by the end of this year. We expect to support E2EE locally this year. Stay tuned for updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Q: Does AFFiNE provide support for end-to-end encryption?**\n\n\nA: AFFiNE's data synchronization is based on conflict-free replication data type (CRDT) technology, which is naturally compatible with end-to-end encryption (E2EE). CRDT also ensures that real-time collaboration is not hindered by geographical restrictions, network speed, and even offline use. AFFiNE gives priority to data security and hopes to promote seamless teamwork within the local network. We expect support for E2EE to be launched in the near future. Stay tuned for updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Q: Where is my page stored?**\n\n\nA:\n\n\n### **`app.getPath(name)`**\n\n\n* `name` string - You can request the following paths by the name:\n\n\n  * `home` User's home directory.\n\n\n  * `appData` Per-user application data directory, which by default points to:\n\n\n    * `%APPDATA%` on Windows\n\n\n    * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config` on Linux\n\n\n    * `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS\n\n\n  * `userData` The directory for storing your app's configuration files, whichby default is the `appData` directory appended with your app's name. Byconvention files storing user data should be written to this directory, andit is not recommended to write large files here because some environmentsmay backup this directory to cloud storage.\n\n\n  * `sessionData` The directory for storing data generated by `Session`, suchas localStorage, cookies, disk cache, downloaded dictionaries, networkstate, devtools files. By default this points to `userData`. Chromium maywrite very large disk cache here, so if your app does not rely on browserstorage like localStorage or cookies to save user data, it is recommendedto set this directory to other locations to avoid polluting the `userData`directory.\n\n\nYou might want to backup the whole `userData` folder. But still it does not ensure the backup will work in the future version. It is recommended to install the same version when you backup, upgrade to the latest version, and backup again.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 6) **Others**\n\n\n### **Q: Is it possible to build 3rd-party plugins now?**\n\n\nA: The plugin system is in early development, accessible exclusively within the Canary version. We are actively progressing with this feature and anticipate its availability by year-end. First-party plugins will be developed initially, followed by integration of GitHub and Figma plugins, scheduled for launch in January 2024. We also plan to introduce a stable API interface in the coming year, enabling users to create third-party plugins.\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Q: What should I do if I want to delete my account and clear the account information?**\n\n\nA: Please send„Äådelete account„Äçrequirement to privacy-request@toeverything.info (need to include: confirmation of account information to be deleted/permission to delete account information, etc.).\n\n\n### **Q: How to cancel the subscription?**\n\n\n1. Open the AFFiNE app\n\n\n1. Click your name\n\n\n1. Click Account Settings\n\n\n1. Scroll to Subscriptions, then click Downgrade\n\n\n1.
