With features tailored for effective brainstorming sessions, such as the ability to create simple wireframes even without design expertise. However, it's important to note that Miro also has notable limitations.\n\n\nFor example, as a proprietary software, Miro's closed-source nature presents potential risks for users(Miro Open source alternatives don't have such issues). Some of the downsides include limited customization options, lack of transparency in the codebase, and dependency on the vendor for updates and bug fixes.\n\n\nAdditionally, users may not have the ability to audit or modify the source code, which could impact security, data privacy, and long-term sustainability. These considerations may be significant factors for users who prioritize open source solutions that offer greater control, transparency, and community-driven development.\n\n\nIn this article, we will explore the top 5 open-source Miro alternatives and highlight their main advantages over Miro alternative.\n\n\n## 1.AFFiNE\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WqOe9HgpsDY?si=PHGuSeRbOT9GxuPO\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the best of Miro Board Alternatives, AFFiNE's Edgeless mode, functioning as a whiteboard and project mangagement tool, offers users a secure and private workspace where they have absolute control over their data. In addition, AFFiNE's Edgeless mode offers a series of features, like shapes with the ability to edit its size, background, and boundary, pens with different colours, and connectors to visualize and connect your ideas.\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/CICpJC16KF9VJNFUAyNpscV-pVlVFlvXtZY1jG5Y0fQ=\"\n  alt=\"open access software\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nOne of the standout features of AFFiNE is its ability to seamlessly switch between paper mode and whiteboard mode (Page and Edgeless), making it a versatile tool for brainstorming, planning, and collaboration. In addition to this, it creates different workspaces for managing various types of data. Whether it’s your personal blog, a team repository, or a personal repository. As one of the best productivity tools,AFFiNE allows you to organize and manage different types of data simultaneously in separate workspaces. This provides a seamless and efficient way to keep your work organized and accessible, without the need for multiple platforms or tools.\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/3a70tVkLm4Nw15ko-eVPKNPIFrghMLMD8kU__yZDMJQ=\"\n  alt=\"open source softwares\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nIn addition to those we mentioned above, the most significant advantages of AFFiNE is its free and open-source nature. Unlike proprietary software like Miro, which may come with licensing fees or restrictions on usage, AFFiNE is completely free to use and open-source.\n\n\nThis means that you can customize and modify the software to suit your specific needs, without any limitations on usage. This also ensures that your data and work are not tied to any proprietary software or vendor, providing you with complete flexibility and control.\n\n\nHowever, though AFFiNE is an open source alternative to Miro, it may not offer the same comprehensive feature set as Miro, which is a mature and established visual collaboration platform. It takes time for AFFiNE to eventually catch Miro in the near future.\n\n\nHere are some quick view of what you can do with AFFiNE.\n\n\n* Database\n\n\n  * Easily create, organize, and track your daily note like never before. Say goodbye to complex processes and welcome an unprecedented ease-of-use way\n\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/1pVKn5mAR6_dns8YGAcWOcZoYIgbVdglRw2nsfmCuCk=\"\n  alt=\"opensource alternative\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\n* Powerful Paper mode for notes taking & wiki\n\n\n  * Build up your content like blocks and let your ideas run wild. Start with an empty space and show the blocks appearing, stacking up, and forming the building.\n\n\n  <img\n  src=\"https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/V9v6_YrAXodDZW-b58xFprHvx7kmiHKHttpBtvv2hXc=\"\n  alt=\"free and open source software\"\n  width=\"auto\"\n  height=\"auto\"\n/>\nIf you wanna know more about what you can do with the use of AFFiNE, can read:\n\n\n* Come and check with our latest [beta version](https://affine.pro/blog/whats-new-affine-0518), enjoy your creative moments.\n\n\n* [5 Best Free Daily Planner Apps for 2023 (Features, Price) | AFFiNE — All In One KnowledgeOS](https://affine.pro/blog/5-best-free-daily-planner-apps-for-2023)\n\n\n* For more things related to AFFiNE, Come and check out our website: [AFFiNE — All In One KnowledgeOS](https://affine.pro/)\n\n\nIn the end, if you are currently Miro users or you are suffering export from Apps like Notion.

Its network of interconnected notes enables a flexible and intuitive workflow, facilitating a holistic view of concepts and promoting insightful discoveries.\n\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Obsidian's whiteboard functionality is not as robust as dedicated collaboration tools.

Miro offers a wide range of pre-designed templates for different use cases, making it possible to maintain a stable internet connection for specific industries or workflows.\n\n\nIn addition, it does not even offer the note taking ways, which may cause loads of inconviences compared with others apps like AFFiNE,which not only offering the Edgeless mode(whiteboard), but also offers a smooth transition to page mode so users can write with the support of blockhubs.\n\n\n## 4.Appflowy\n\n\n\n![0LBqy-DTeZFjkscoqY8jafmPr8vF3gnifItR4UwK1co=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/0LBqy-DTeZFjkscoqY8jafmPr8vF3gnifItR4UwK1co=)\n\n\n[AppFlowy](https://www.appflowy.io/), a user-friendly and feature-rich productivity tool that is both free and open source, offers a flexible and intuitive workspace designed to help users effortlessly manage their tasks, notes, and projects, while prioritizing data security and privacy, and addressing painpoints and risks often associated with proprietary software like Miro.\n\n\nWith its innovative functions, such as seamless collaboration, customizable workflows, creating flowcharts, and powerful search capabilities, AppFlowy empowers individuals, teams, and organizations to enhance their productivity, streamline workflows, and achieve their goals with ease and efficiency.\n\n\nHowever, while AppFlowy offers flexible task management and note-taking capabilities, it may not have the same level of visual collaboration features as Miro.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Miro is designed for visual collaboration in various use cases, such as brainstorming, ideation, design thinking, agile workflows, and project management. So, depending on the specific needs of a team or organization, Miro may be a better fit for certain use cases compared to AppFlowy.\n\n\n## 5.Logseq\n\n\n\n![c4WINrBm-yfaXWXHFPR7eNW7xtehTlLo8a6kBZKH1so=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/c4WINrBm-yfaXWXHFPR7eNW7xtehTlLo8a6kBZKH1so=)\n\n\n[Logseq](https://logseq.com/) is a powerful and advanced tool for thought that has been gaining attention among note-taking enthusiasts and productivity seekers.
