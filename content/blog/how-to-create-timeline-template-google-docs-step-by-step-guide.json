Templates allow you to create timelines right away rather than starting from scratch with a blank document by using predefined fields to guide your creation.\n\n\n## Benefits of Using a Timeline Template\n\n\n1. Stay organized. Trying to keep track of all the details of a project manually can be extremely difficult and time-consuming. But with a timeline template, everything is laid out in an easy-to-understand format. This can help you avoid missing important details, and keep your project on track overall.\n\n\n1. More professional-looking results. If you need to present information in a polished and professional way, then using a timeline template is definitely the way to go. With its clean and sleek design, a timeline created with a template just looks more put together than something thrown together at the last minute.\n\n\n## Step-by-step Guide: Creating a Timeline Template in Google Docs\n\n\n**Step 1: Setting up the Document**\n\n\nAssuming you have a Google account (if not, create one now ‚Äì it‚Äôs free), head over to [docs.google.com](http://docs.google.com ) and sign in.\n\n\nTitle your document ‚ÄúTimeline Template‚Äù and save it to your Google Drive.\n\n\n\n![C6c0rEofCO_Ftaq2EzV9CDGSKmGZbjcyOAKUaJbySNQ=](/blobs/C6c0rEofCO_Ftaq2EzV9CDGSKmGZbjcyOAKUaJbySNQ=)\n\n\nThe first step is to change the page orientation from portrait to landscape.\n\n\nNext, increase the page size by going to File > Page setup and increasing the width under ‚ÄúPaper size.‚Äù\n\n\nNow that you have a landscape-oriented, wider page, it‚Äôs time to add some text boxes for your timeline content.\n\n\n\n![WWno-QVUfhzjkcq5Plwa_levvdqDecwk_nEGM_9ZE6I=](/blobs/WWno-QVUfhzjkcq5Plwa_levvdqDecwk_nEGM_9ZE6I=)\n\n\nOnce you have all of your text boxes set up, it‚Äôs time to start adding content!\n\n\n**Step 2: Creating Headers and Columns**\n\n\nNext, it‚Äôs time to start creating your headers and columns. In your Google Doc, navigate to the File menu. Click the arrow tool from the Line drop-down menu.\n\n\n**Step 3: Adding Dates and Events**\n\n\nClick on the \"Add Date\" or \"Add Event\" button in the upper-right corner of the template.\n\n\n**Step 4: Formatting Your Timeline Template**\n\n\nAssuming you've already followed the previous steps and have created a timeline template in Google Docs, it's now time to format it to your liking.\n\n\n\n![XnnXUPoJ0N5cy8u1SbAkDjpDLS2rdvsifFXj3TwA_rQ=](/blobs/XnnXUPoJ0N5cy8u1SbAkDjpDLS2rdvsifFXj3TwA_rQ=)\n\n\n**Lines:** Lines are a great way to help organize your timeline template.\n\n\n**Shapes:** Shapes can be used to highlight important information on your timeline template.\n\n\nNow that you know what types of elements you can add to your timeline template.\n\n\nAnd there you have it! Your very own creative timeline template was created in Google Docs!\n\n\n**Creating timelines in Google Docs is certainly possible, but it may not be the most suitable option in the long run.**\n\n\n1. Offline work is not available. Google offers a Drive app for Chrome as well as a Drive desktop program that allows offline access to your entire Drive content including files in Docs. However, before working offline, you will need to initiate the setup of Drive offline and choose which files you want to use without internet beforehand, or else you won't be able to get to your files swiftly if your wifi has an unexpected outage.\n\n\n1. Limited workflow capabilities. Task scheduling and assigning on Google Docs is inconvenient as you can only create a basic timeline by manipulating a Google document since this application is basically created to create and share documents like Microsoft Word.\n\n\n**It's time to try something new!**\n\n\nCreating your timeline templates in Google Docs is not the only option available, and there are some fantastic alternatives to consider. It's a good thing there are better and easier alternatives, like AFFiNE, a powerful timeline maker, project manager, note-taker, time tracker, and so much more. So why not try some incredible tools as follows:\n\n\n## Top 4 alternative timeline templates maker\n\n\n### 1.[AFFiNE](http://affine.pro)\n\n\n**Best used for timeline templates creation**\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WqOe9HgpsDY?si=PHGuSeRbOT9GxuPO\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a dedicated tool with various modes to write, draw and plan, AFFiNE is an excellent alternative to Google Docs.
