As the host of this event, **Anne** invited two distinguished developers renowned in the open-source project domain: **Dan Abramov and Yifeng Wang**. They shared their rich experiences working in both large corporations and entrepreneurial ventures. Approximately 100 participants engaged in this event, and the two guest speakers addressed a plethora of intriguing questions, offering profound insights and valuable advice.\n\n\n* **Dan Abramov**\n\n\n\n![jkALUPwrEgCtJvBVaKsZ1VED37UE7MysqCg5ZbF5EtQ=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/jkALUPwrEgCtJvBVaKsZ1VED37UE7MysqCg5ZbF5EtQ=)\n\n\n* **Yifeng Wang**\n\n\n\n![8XJUtPIwR0I7BQs5-1F_mSMNK_S7iCz-TXSBouHyAt8=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/8XJUtPIwR0I7BQs5-1F_mSMNK_S7iCz-TXSBouHyAt8=)\n\n\n# Five Captivating Questions from the Roundtable Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Q: What are the p**ros and cons of working in a big company?**\n\n\n**Pros**: Dan mentioned **stability and welfare** as potential pros, the opportunity to **learn from a diverse group of experts** within the organization, and the possibility of **internal mobility** if you become bored in your current role. Yifeng emphasized **predictability** in career advancement, a structured environment, and the ability to **gain recognition through branding** when contributing to different projects or communities.\n\n\n**Cons**: Dan discussed the often stressful and time-consuming nature of **performance reviews** and noted **a sense of complacency** in larger companies. He also pointed out that excessive processes and rigid work structures could be downsides, along with the challenges of internal mobility. Yifeng mentioned the limited scope of work in larger companies, which can lead to being highly specialized and sometimes pigeonholed in niche roles. He also alluded to the potential for **a less dynamic work environment**.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Q: What are the pros and cons of working for a small company?\n\n\nYifeng underscores that small companies often provide more **freedom and autonomy** for employees. This sentiment aligns with the idea that working in a small company allows for more independence and decision-making autonomy. Yifeng also hints at the potential for direct impact, where employees have a tangible influence on the company's success. These aspects can be highly motivating and fulfilling for those who value the sense of ownership and control over their work.\n\n\nFurthermore, Yifeng highlights that small companies are more **engineering-focused** and emphasize **open-source contributions**. This emphasis on engineering aligns with the notion of learning opportunities, as employees may wear multiple hats and gain a broader range of experiences. The connection to open source suggests a collaborative environment where innovation and adaptability are encouraged, fitting perfectly with the idea that smaller companies foster closer collaboration and faster decision-making.\n\n\nWhile Yifeng's response primarily highlights the advantages of working in a small company, he does touch upon the potential drawbacks, such as **limited resources**. This limitation can constrain project scope and hinder career growth, representing one of the downsides of smaller organizations. It's essential to acknowledge that Yifeng's perspective may be influenced by his personal experience.\n\n\n\n![BfeGRwJGcCC9jvS6EMfmvx1svbiAvkWmoNASwo3iAYk=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/BfeGRwJGcCC9jvS6EMfmvx1svbiAvkWmoNASwo3iAYk=)\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Q: **How do big companies address challenging problems and ensure performance?**\n\n\nYifeng emphasized the importance of convincing leadership through logic and demonstrating the **return on investment (ROI)** when solving complex issues. He highlighted that the methodologies for solving problems don't differ significantly between large and small companies and that best practices in engineering remain consistent.\n\n\nDan added that **a mature engineering culture** is important for addressing complex issues. He stressed the significance of understanding the root cause of problems before attempting to fix them. He criticized the immature mindset of trying different libraries to optimize performance without first understanding the underlying issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Q: What role does innovation play in your career aspirations?\n\n\nDan's perspective on career aspirations revolves around **a practical approach to innovation**. He expressed that his motivation doesn't necessarily center on changing the world but rather on **making things better**, particularly when he's intrigued by a specific technology or tool. His key philosophy lies in understanding complex problems at a profound level, which entails dissecting and solving intricate issues. Dan also highlighted the importance of surrounding oneself with **experienced individuals** and the valuable learning that can occur by merely observing and learning from those who have more experience.\n\n\nYifeng shared his career journey, underscoring the excitement he derives from working on open-source projects and **embracing new technologies**. He echoed the idea that **pursuing one's interests** is a crucial aspect of career growth and development. Yifeng emphasized the value of deep experience gained through involvement in open-source initiatives and tackling various challenges. His approach to innovation involves immersing oneself in these projects and taking on novel tasks, an approach that has evidently been rewarding for his career path.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Q: Do you have any career advice for new graduates?\n\n\n* **Gain Experience Through Open Source**: Both emphasized the value of participating in open source communities and projects. Contributing to open source can help you improve your skills, learn from experienced developers, and make a positive impact on software used by many.\n\n\n* **Learn by Working on Real Problems**: Dan highlighted the importance of being thrown into challenging situations where you face real issues and problems. Tackling difficult bugs or complex projects that push your skills and knowledge can be an effective way to learn and grow as a developer.\n\n\n* **Surround Yourself with Experienced Developers**: Dan stressed the significance of being surrounded by more experienced developers who can serve as mentors or simply provide guidance through observation. Learning from the approaches and problem-solving methods of experienced colleagues can be highly beneficial.\n\n\n* **Follow Your Interests**: Yifeng suggested following your interests when deciding what to learn next. Pursuing areas of technology or projects that genuinely intrigue you can be motivating and lead to substantial growth in your career.\n\n\n* **Focus on Deep Understanding**: Dan recommended diving deep into problems or projects to understand them thoroughly. This involves dissecting issues, breaking them down into smaller components, and analyzing what's happening within the code. This analytical approach can enhance your problem-solving abilities.\n\n\n\n![RgIKoA_PZJ8G5GEq8G5kfNlR3kuMyS1KIpavHS95_VI=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/RgIKoA_PZJ8G5GEq8G5kfNlR3kuMyS1KIpavHS95_VI=)\n\n\nIn conclusion, the two participants shared their valuable perspectives on working within large companies, shedding light on the multitude of advantages and disadvantages that come with such experiences.
