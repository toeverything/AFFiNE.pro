Real-Time Participation: Participants are required to create their drawings directly on the AFFiNE whiteboard during the contest period. This ensures that all submissions are original and created specifically for the competition.\n1. Prohibit External Whiteboards: It is strictly prohibited for participants to use or reference any other whiteboard software or tools during the contest. This ensures a level playing field and encourages participants to fully utilize the features and capabilities of the AFFiNE whiteboard.\n1. Disable Copy and Paste: To maintain the integrity of the competition, we have modified the AFFiNE whiteboard to disable the copy and paste feature. This prevents participants from copying existing artwork or elements into their submissions.\n1. Watermark Requirement: In order to identify original submissions, participants are asked to include a visible watermark in their drawings. This helps maintain authenticity and prevents the unauthorized use of artwork.\n1. Parental Permission for Participants under 16: Participants who are under the age of 16 will need to obtain basic permission from their parents or guardians to participate in the contest. We value the safety and well-being of all participants and want to ensure appropriate consent is obtained for underage participants.\n## Where to apply it?\n\nThe application process requires not only your basic information but also a rigorous adherence to the criteria, including the mandatory upload of your artwork through the provided Typeform.\n\n**Here's the link you can apply for once you finished your work:** [Click here to apply](https://6dxre9ihosp.typeform.com/to/h1MC1hJG)\n\n## **Following our Channels👇**\n\n* Official Website: [https://affine.pro/](https://affine.pro/)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE)\n* Discord: [https://discord.gg/Arn7TqJBvG](https://discord.gg/Arn7TqJBvG)\n* Telegram: [https://t.me/affineworkos](https://t.me/affineworkos)\n",
