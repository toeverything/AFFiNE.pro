By associating your notes with relevant tags or organizing them into custom categories, you can create an additional layer of organization and facilitate the discovery of related content.\n\n\n#### Enhancing Discoverability and Connections\n\n\nTags and categories in AFFiNE act as virtual bridges, connecting pages that share common themes, topics, or contexts. This organizational structure enables you to quickly identify and navigate between relevant notes, fostering a more cohesive and interconnected personal knowledge base.\n\n\n#### Flexible Linking Strategies\n\n\nWhether you prefer to use backlinking, tags, categories, or a combination of these approaches, AFFiNE empowers you to tailor your page-linking strategies to suit your unique knowledge management needs and workflows.
