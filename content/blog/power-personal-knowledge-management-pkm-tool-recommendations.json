We're constantly bombarded with data, from endless search results to the relentless stream of social media updates, from professional reports to personal notes. How do we maintain clarity and efficiency in this complex world?\n\n\nðŸš€**Enter the stage for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)!**\n\n\n# What is PKM (Personal Knowledge Management)?\n\n\nPersonal Knowledge Management (PKM) is a process that involves collecting, organizing, and storing information for easy searching, retrieval, editing, and future use. In today's digital world, where we are constantly bombarded with information, PKM helps individuals manage this influx to enhance [productivity](https://affine.pro/blog/best-time-management-tools-techniques-create) and decision-making. It's a skill that enables you to handle daily information effectively, preventing overload and facilitating a smoother workflow. PKM tools are designed to capture and organize data, offering benefits like increased productivity, streamlined workflows, and improved collaboration. These tools are essential for thriving in the modern workplace, allowing for quick access to information and fostering a culture of knowledge sharing among teams.\n\n\n# Why Do We Need Personal Knowledge Management?\n\n\n* **Combat Information Overload**: In the digital era, we're swamped with data.
