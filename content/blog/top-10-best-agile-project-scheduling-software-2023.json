Agile projects often involve cross-functional teams working together in real-time. Look for software that allows seamless communication and collaboration among team members, whether through chat functions or shared dashboards.\n\n\n* **Integration.** Your agile project scheduling software should be able to integrate with other tools your team uses regularly, such as task management systems or bug-tracking platforms.
