Explore the top 10 apps where linked notes meet mindmaps, including the powerful AFFiNE for an enhanced note-taking experience.\"\n\n\ncreated: 2024-01-08\n\n\nupdated: 2024-01-08\n\n\nlayout: blog\n\n\npublish: true\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n![PO7doHhozF-qMkP4XhAjlrZ-u_WAlD3lt5U7GlKfXqE=](/blobs/PO7doHhozF-qMkP4XhAjlrZ-u_WAlD3lt5U7GlKfXqE=)\n\n\nAre you still jotting down your thoughts and notes with pen and paper?\n\n\nImagine that there are now some visual note-taking tools where you can not only capture text that comes to your mind at any time but also [organize](https://affine.pro/blog/best-free-whiteboard-layout-ideas-organization) your logical thinking with mind maps, making your notes clearer!\n\n\nIn an era where the classic method of jotting down thoughts and notes with pen and paper has been prevalent for years, a new wave of technological innovation is transforming the way we capture and express our ideas. Visual note-taking apps, although relatively recent in their emergence, have swiftly gained prominence among individuals who derive satisfaction from witnessing their thoughts, notes, and visual concepts materialize dynamically.\n\n\nUnlike the traditional pen-and-paper approach, visual note-taking apps provide a digital [canvas](https://affine.pro/blog/affine-0-11-0-launch-day-4-navigating-canvas-complexity-templates-clarity-free-online-whiteboard) where users can illustrate, connect ideas, and create visual representations of their thoughts. This shift from the tangible to the digital realm offers a dynamic and interactive experience, allowing users to engage with their ideas in a more fluid and flexible manner.\n\n\n# What Are Visual Note-Taking Apps?\n\n\nVisual note-taking apps are digital tools designed for creating and organizing notes using a combination of [text](https://affine.pro/blog/affine-0-11-0-launch-day-3-beyond-text-color-history-table-of-content-possibilities), images, drawings, and multimedia elements. These applications offer a visual and interactive platform for users to express ideas and information in a more dynamic and engaging manner compared to traditional text-based notes.\n\n\n\n![iE7zbQhptSVVLhMMC7wIrnan6BhDZ0ZvdBO-luSFEao=](/blobs/iE7zbQhptSVVLhMMC7wIrnan6BhDZ0ZvdBO-luSFEao=)\n\n\n* **Multimodal Content Creation**: Visual note-taking apps allow users to create notes that combine text, drawings, images, and other multimedia elements. Users can express ideas in a more dynamic and engaging way compared to traditional text-based notes.\n\n\n* **[Mind Mapping](https://affine.pro/blog/8-top-best-mindmap-making-software-project-planning-2023) and Diagrams**: Many visual note-taking apps support mind mapping, allowing users to create hierarchical diagrams that represent relationships between concepts. Diagrams and flowcharts can be used to visualize processes, ideas, and connections between different pieces of information.\n\n\n* **Real-Time Editing and Updates**: Users can make real-time edits to visual notes, making it easy to update and modify information as needed. This feature is particularly useful in dynamic environments where information is subject to change.\n\n\n* **Digital Accessibility**: Visual note-taking apps provide the convenience of digital access to notes, enabling users to access and edit their visual notes across various devices. Cloud-based storage and synchronization features ensure that notes are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.\n\n\n* **Export and Sharing Options**: Visual note-taking apps stand out for their diverse export and sharing options, allowing users to effortlessly export notes as PDFs or image files or share them via convenient links. These versatile features ensure accessibility and promote enhanced collaboration. Streamlined sharing capabilities facilitate the easy dissemination of information, fostering a collaborative environment where ideas flow freely and efficiently.\n\n\n# Contrast with Traditional Note-Taking Software\n\n\nIn comparison to traditional note-taking software, such as [Evernote](https://affine.pro/blog/best-evernote-alternatives-and-competitors-for-note-taking), visual note-taking apps diverge significantly. While common note-taking apps often rely on list-based formats, visual note apps stand out due to their unique layout. Unlike their counterparts, these apps permit users to freely move notes around a canvas, fostering a more interactive and spatial note-taking experience.\n\n\n* **[Layout](https://affine.pro/blog/best-free-whiteboard-layout-ideas-organization) Flexibility**: The key distinction lies in the layout flexibility offered by visual note apps. Unlike the rigidity of list-based notes, visual note-taking apps provide a dynamic environment where users can manipulate and arrange their notes freely on a canvas, mimicking the unrestricted nature of a whiteboard.\n\n\n* **Connectivity of Notes**: Depending on the software, advanced visual note-taking apps often feature the ability to connect notes, allowing users to establish meaningful relationships between various concepts and ideas.\n\n\n* **Daily Note-Taking and Visual Integration**: More sophisticated visual note-taking tools frequently support daily note-taking routines and seamlessly integrate visual elements into the canvas. This enhances the overall note-taking experience, making it more immersive and comprehensive.\n\n\n# Top 10 Visual Note-Taking Apps with Mindmaps\n\n\n## 1.
