It allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating with other users in real-time. Google Docs is part of the Google Drive suite of office tools, which also includes Sheets (spreadsheets) and Slides (presentations). The software is accessible from any device with an internet connection and a web browser, and it offers features such as document sharing, commenting, and revision history.\n\n## Reasons to Consider a Google Docs Alternative\n\nEven though Google Drive is a widely-used cloud storage platform that is popular among both individuals and organisations it is not the best tool for knowledge management due to its lack of essential features and functionality.\n\n1. Limited collaboration elements: While Google Docs has basic content collaboration features, it lacks advanced ones like custom task structures, progress tracking, and time tracking.\n1. Difficult to use as a document and knowledge base system: Google Docs can be challenging to use as a knowledge base due to its poor file organization and difficulty in creating a decent filing system. Additionally, sharing and permissions can be complex, which can lead to business risks.\n1. Poor file organization: Google Docs saves all documents on Google Drive, which can be cluttered and make document search and finding very difficult.\n1. Can't create subpages: Google Docs doesn't let you create subpages or nest pages, which limits knowledge management. Nesting pages allow you to create a well-structured document with some pages set as subpages of primary pages. Without subpages, your documents can become complex and difficult to organize.Top 5 Google Docs Alternatives for Pers\n## **Top 5 Google Docs Alternatives for Personal Knowledge Management in 2023**\n\n### [1.AFFiNE](http://affine.pro)\n\n_**Best used for Knowledge Management**_\n\n\n![noMdtrK1-xLDD6DpcwrfAoEpE2FeoGN3wxppqhqYbHY=](https://insider.affine.pro/api/workspaces/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blobs/noMdtrK1-xLDD6DpcwrfAoEpE2FeoGN3wxppqhqYbHY=)\n\nAFFiNE is a fantastic alternative to Google Docs, especially for knowledge management.
