Whatever the reason, there are many alternatives to OneNote that can provide a better note-taking experience.\n\n\nSome common reasons why users may need an alternative to OneNote include:\n\n\n* **Limited Customization Options**: OneNote’s interface can be overwhelming, and some users may find it difficult to customize the app to their liking.
