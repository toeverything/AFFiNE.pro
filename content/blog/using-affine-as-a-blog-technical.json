How we did it.\n\ncreated: 2023-03-06\n\nupdated: 2023-03-06\n\nlayout: blog\n\npublish: true\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n![qEa2IgxShxz2kEizrA8cZvBftWVw1q36Vi8c7Hikf0A=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/qEa2IgxShxz2kEizrA8cZvBftWVw1q36Vi8c7Hikf0A=)\n\nAFFiNE is great and we think it is ready for use in the wild. So in order to align our actions with our beliefs, we have decided to migrate our existing blog to AFFiNE.\n\nIn this article, we will share with you the reasons behind our decision to switch to our own product and the benefits we hope to achieve, as well as the challenges we faced along the way. We hope that our experience will inspire and guide other users who are looking to integrate and utilise AFFiNE in their own workflows.\n\n## Switching to our own product\n\nAside from explicit testing we are always looking for more ways we can expand how we use AFFiNE in-house. Not only do we want to better understand and relate to our users but we also are looking to promote a positive work culture.\n\nThe more we use AFFiNE the more we can embrace and appreciate the feature ideas and/or issues raised by our users. We take community feedback very seriously and we give serious thought to everything that is brought upd And by using the product internally, we will create more shared experiences among employees, which will foster our own sense of community and collaboration. We want everyone to feel proud of the work they have done, and the product that has been produced.\n\nIt will also make the process of writing on our blog much easier. Currently our blog lives together with the whole official website. So any updates may impact the whole AFFiNE homepage in their shared repo. So this also brings a rather large learning curve to any non-technical members who have to learn Markdown, Git, GitHub and how to deploy articles. AFFiNE offers the perfect solution to make blogging an easy and accessible for everyone.\n\n## Setting up the new blog\n\nThe old blog was a standard Next.js blog and post files are static markdown files that are managed in a GitHub repo: the file directory & names generate the file tree and routes; post metadata is in form of frontmatter and is placed at the beginning of a post, and content is written in markdown. Each of the files will be parsed and pre-rendered as static Next pages.\n\nThere are lots of various great community-driven projects utilising lots of different software, that allow the user to render their content managed. Whether that is using databases to other types of media, such as Next.js-powered blogs. We wondered if it would be possible to write our blog using AFFiNE.\n\nAlthough the AFFiNE project is relatively new, we think it would be cool to do the same. However, we have no official public APIs that make it easy to do this yet. [AFFiNE Downhills](https://affine.pro/blog/downhills-release-announcement) introduces the public workspace, which means your workspace content can be shared with anyone else without the need for authentication. This gives us an opportunity to read the workspace documents from the public AFFiNE API.  For example, you can get the workspace data by calling`https://app.affine.pro/api/public/doc/{workspaceId}/` .\n\n### Getting the markdown files from public workspace API\n\nTo build a Next.js site, it is essential to have a list of available files and the file contents. For real-world usage, we will also put some metadata information for the file contents, such as tags, authors, whether it is a draft or not (publish status), and so on.\n\nTheoretically, if we can convert a yDoc to a list of markdown files, then our job is mostly done. However, the only reader of the workspace yDoc is blocksuite, but it doesn't allow us to convert yDoc to Markdown files yet. Therefore, our new AFFiNE team member, [Peng](https://github.com/pengx17) , wrote a library called \"[affine-reader](https://github.com/pengx17/affine-reader) \" to parse yDoc binary into markdown files with some simple functions.\n\nTechnically, affine-reader does the following:\n\n1. Reads the page list from yDoc\n1. For each page (which is a list of blocks), get Quill delta of each block\n1. Converts delta to markdown (using a fork of [https://github.com/frysztak/quill-delta-to-markdown](https://github.com/frysztak/quill-delta-to-markdown))\n1. Concatenates block-level markdowns into a single markdown page\nIf you are familiar with Next.js, we can use `getStaticPaths` to generate the static page routes and `getStaticProps` to get each page’s markdown content. In Next.13 App Layout, you can even render the post list and a random post like this pretty easily:\n\n```javascript\n// [workspaceId]/page.tsx\nimport { getBlocksuiteReader } from \"blocksuite-reader\";\n\nexport default async function Post(params: { workspaceId: string, pageId: string }) {\n  const reader = getBlocksuiteReader({\n    params.workspaceId,\n  });\n  const pages = await reader.getWorkspacePages());\n  return (\n    <div>\n       <ul>{/* ... render page list */}</ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// [workspaceId]/[pageId].tsx\nimport { getBlocksuiteReader } from \"blocksuite-reader\";\n\nimport { mdToHTML } from \"./md-to-html\";\n\nexport default async function Post(params: { workspaceId: string, pageId: string }) {\n  const reader = getBlocksuiteReader({\n    params.workspaceId,\n  });\n  const page = await reader.getWorkspacePage(params.pageId));\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <article dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: mdToHTML(page.md) }} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe primary issue is resolved. To be more creative, we can include frontmatter at the beginning of the page to define some metadata for the current page, such as authors, tags, whether or not to publish this page, etc.  Additionally, we can use MDX to enrich both the default and custom elements of the page by embedding link previews and other interactive components.\n\nBy implementing Next.js infrastructure and enabling ISR, we eliminate the need to rebuild and deploy the blog each time content is updated. Moving forward, we can focus on using AFFiNE as our CMS to write posts for the blog. This will allow us to easily manage and publish our content with minimal hassle.\n\n## Migrating the old blog\n\nAt the time of writing there were around 50 articles that needed migrating over, that would be a fairly boring manual task to perform so why not make it a little more interesting and utilise some code to help us do that a little quicker\n\n### Challenge 1: Getting our files\n\nOur old blog lived inside the general AFFiNE homepage repo and followed a structure of `/blog/{YEAR}/{MONTH}/{SLUG}/` . An example would be `blog/2023/02/moving-to-app-affine-pro` and then inside this folder there is an `index.md` file which is the contents of the article, supported by an `images` folder with all of the relevant images for the article.\n\nSo first things first, let's take a copy of that `blog` folder. It would make things easier if everything was all in one folder, not in different sub directories and that's where our first challenge comes.\n\n#### **What do we want to do?**\n\n1. We want to find every file)\n  1. The structure is `/blog/{YEAR}/{MONTH}/{SLUG}/index.md`\n1. We want to move these files to a shared directory\n  1. So we cannot leave them all with the `index.md` name\n#### **How can we do this?**\n\nLet's just move all our files `//blog/` we just need to match the pattern `/blog/*/*/*/index.md` so that deals with the first task fairly easily. And for thje let's use the slug (the last part of the url of the article) as that's going to give a unique name without special characters. We can get the slug from checking the last folder name `/blog/{YEAR}/{MONTH}/{SLUG}/`.\n\nSo how shall we go about doing this? Well lets just put together a simple little bash script.\n\n```javascript\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor file in /blog/*/*/*/index.md\ndo\n  directory=$(dirname \"$file\")\n  article_title=$(basename \"$directory\")\n  mv \"$file\" \"$directory/../../../${article_title}.md\"\ndone\n```\n\n1. So first we just declare this is a bash file `#!/bin/bash`\n1. Next we get every file that matches our pattern `/blog/*/*/*/index.md`\n1. One by one we take the matched `file` and then perform the `do` operations\n1. Let's get the current directory `directory=$(dirname \"$file\"`\n1. Let's get the article title by checking the last directory `article_title=$(basename \"$directory\")`\n1. And finally let's move all these files - take our original `$file` and move it to up 3 folders `../../../` to the `/blog` folder giving it the new `article_title` name.\nGreat all our files are in the blog folder with unique names and we can just upload them now? No, not quite yet...\n\n### Challenge 2: Updating the metadata\n\nThere are some key things that our blog shows that are not strictly part of the article - these items are our metadata that contains lots of configurable options to be displayed on the article but are not part of the main content.\n\n```javascript\n---\ntitle: Moving to app.affine.pro\nauthor: Christopher Smolak\ntags: User Guide\ncover: ./images/cover.jpg\ndescription: A big step forward for AFFiNE\ncreated: 2023-02-20\nupdated: 2023-02-20\nlayout: blog\n---\n```\n\nNow this doesn't really prevent too many issues - our new blog system builds on the old setup and can understand this information and know to exclude it from the main article content. However, with this update we added two new features that are crucial to being shown and available on the blog.\n\n#### What do we need to update?\n\n1. We can remove `cover` as it's no longer relevant - we can upload images as blobs to AFFiNE and can simply use the first image in the article as the cover image\n1. We need to add the new `slug` option to make our blog URLs beautiful and to avoid a mess of random characters. Good job we set our filename to our slug earlier\n1. We need to add the new `publish` option and set it to `true`\n#### **How can we do this?**\n\nLet's again go with a simple little bash script.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor file in $(ls -t -r /blog/*.md)\ndo\n  slug=$(basename \"$file\" | sed 's/\\.md//' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')\n  sed -i '' '5d' \"$file\"\n  sed -i '' \"4a\\ \nslug: ${slug}\\\n\n\" \"$file\"\n  sed -i '' \"9a\\ \npublish: true\\\n\n\" \"$file\"\ndone\n```\n\n1. As usual lets acknowledge this is a bash file `#!/bin/bash`\n1. So again we are going to `do` things to each file in our `blog` folder - for all of the `.md` files\n  1. We want to keep the order of files (from oldest to newest) to import them in the write order hence we use `ls -t -r /blog/*.md`\n1. Firstly let's get the file name - which I have called `slug`.\n  1. Get the filename `basename \"$file\"`.\"\n  1. Remove the `.md` extension with `sed 's/\\.md//'`\n  1. Ensure the string is all lowercase `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`\n1. Next we remove line 5 which is the `cover` option `sed -i '' '5d' \"$file`\n1. Then at the end of line 4 we start a new line and define our `slug` option with `sed -i '' \"4a\\ slug: ${slug}\\ \" \"$file\"` - the new lines force the new line to be entered in the doc\n1. Similarly, but starting on line 5, we start a new line and we set `publish: true` with   `sed -i '' \"9a\\ publish: true\\ \" \"$file\"`- again the formatting is matched in the file  (new lines)\nGreat, all done? Well we still need to upload these files to AFFiNE right?\n\n### Challenge 3: Uploading to AFFiNE\n\nAFFiNE doesn't yet, at the time of writing, offer an API. That makes this task impossible right? Not quite... Again let's add some automation and see what we can do.\n\nAnd poof! A neat little product that can automatically import your data into AFFiNE. For its initial purpose it has been setup to work with `.md` files but could be re-configured to import any content files - such as `.doc` files and `.html` files.\n\n[ShortCipher5/AFFiNE-Importer (github.com)](https://github.com/ShortCipher5/AFFiNE-Importer)\n\nIt's a much longer script so maybe another article if you are interested in this little code project specifically. And it's open-source for you to go ahead, check it out and have a play. Looking forward to your own projects and PRs are welcome.\n\nTo summarise this script uses Microsoft Playwright to automate Chromium and perform the actions of `copy and paste` which you'd otherwise have to do manually.\n\nEven with this app it didn't solve everything. There was still the process of having to manually adding images (this also could be automated with more time). And in terms of the automation code itself it relies on copy-paste of data which means we have to force the code to wait sometimes to allow for the copy and paste actions to complete - with an arbitrary wait time - which no doubt can also be improved on.\n\nThe main part is that this helped significantly in lowering the manual cost and time needed to migrate these articles over.\n\n\n\nLet's take a quick look at it in action:\n\n\n![hLo595V8PtMkLAz63KPasmu7KGHRtxgrwPpBCCqvLO4=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/hLo595V8PtMkLAz63KPasmu7KGHRtxgrwPpBCCqvLO4=)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this article and found some of the points and discussions useful.
