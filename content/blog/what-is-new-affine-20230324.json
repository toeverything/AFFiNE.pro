We consistently work hard on developing and improving the user experience. Here are some improvements that are most imperative for users:\n\n* Improved: AFFiNE(Downhills version) supports far more settings for the pen colour, thickness, shape replacement and shortcut key to trigger in Edgeless mode. Let's release your creativity!\n\n\n\n![uJItGlMre0jTgRRE7jHDiCBcmFXuX35UqBBGZPIbPBk=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/uJItGlMre0jTgRRE7jHDiCBcmFXuX35UqBBGZPIbPBk=)\n\n* Improved: Users now can use Slash Commands to style various blocks, such as bold, italics, underscores, etc\n  * Link: [https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/issues/1184](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/issues/1184)\n\n![qpQLvuLO3hbehURU2DZB0Hm1DizQzCXH1dNS0WgCAS0=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/qpQLvuLO3hbehURU2DZB0Hm1DizQzCXH1dNS0WgCAS0=)\n\n* Improved: The problem that the \"undo\" function does not work properly when editing or deleting inline code or links in a document or text editor is now being solved.\n  * Link: [https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/issues/1456](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/issues/1456)\n* Improved: The Zoom in/out shortcut key for Edgeless on Mac should be ⌘ + scroll wheel, not Ctrl + scroll wheel (#1652)\n  * Link: [https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/issues/1652](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/issues/1652)\n## 2) Bug fixed\n\nSeveral bugs and issues that were reported by our users have also been addressed. These bug fixes include:\n\n* Fixed: Unable to resolve playground modules after bumping to TypeScript 5.0 (#1755)\n  * Details: There is an issue with resolving modules in the playground, which is causing errors or preventing the code from running properly.
