  "md": "The updated AFFiNE(Downhills version) brings a more powerful edgeless mode (by supporting far more settings of pen, shape etc.), a slick experience, and a few other fixed bugs for you to use.\n\n\n## 1) Improvement\n\n\nMaking AFFiNE the most reliable all-in-one knowledge management base is one of our main concerns. We consistently work hard on developing and improving the user experience. Here are some improvements that are most imperative for users:\n\n\n* Improved: AFFiNE(Downhills version) supports far more settings for the pen colour, thickness, shape replacement and shortcut key to trigger in Edgeless mode.

These bug fixes include:\n\n\n* Fixed: Unable to resolve playground modules after bumping to TypeScript 5.0 (#1755)\n\n\n  * Details: There is an issue with resolving modules in the playground, which is causing errors or preventing the code from running properly.
