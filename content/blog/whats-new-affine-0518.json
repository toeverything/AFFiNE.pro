Say goodbye to the hassle of manually downloading and installing updates, and enjoy the latest features and improvements without any interruption to your workflow.\n\n\n  * Link: [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/pull/2214](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/pull/2214)\n\n\n  * **Windows is not supported currently, since we are working on gaining certificate-related stuff.

We care our windows users, and we believe this will be fixed soon in the stable version.\n\n\n  * **In addition, using the export single db and throwing it to the network disk for automatic sync is not recommended, it might cause some unexpected results.**\n\n\n\n![LiGCCCf1XYNYNAkdLgh1FzGf8wSmVnIsfLekiMBuiOk=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/LiGCCCf1XYNYNAkdLgh1FzGf8wSmVnIsfLekiMBuiOk=)\n\n\n* **Database**\n\n\n  * Easily create, organize, and track your data like never before.
