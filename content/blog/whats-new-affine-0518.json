Say goodbye to the hassle of manually downloading and installing updates, and enjoy the latest features and improvements without any interruption to your workflow.\n\n\n  * Link: [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/pull/2214](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/pull/2214)\n\n\n  * **Windows is not supported currently, since we are working on gaining certificate-related stuff. It will be supported soon.**\n\n\n\n![E5-CB_tqGpX8WHvgf9lx9sZxcgnaPKr5B_Cjn3h9igg=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/E5-CB_tqGpX8WHvgf9lx9sZxcgnaPKr5B_Cjn3h9igg=.webp)\n\n\n* **Local Workspace storage logic**\n\n\n  * The beta version provides the option for our users to customize the storage path of their data. Now our users can get full control over where and how they are able to store their own data in the workspace setting.\n\n\n  * Link: [https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/pull/2122](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/pull/2122)\n\n\n  * We applogize again that Windows is not supported currently since there's a string of bugs left to be revised. We care our windows users, and we believe this will be fixed soon in the stable version.\n\n\n  * **In addition, using the export single db and throwing it to the network disk for automatic sync is not recommended, it might cause some unexpected results.**\n\n\n\n![LiGCCCf1XYNYNAkdLgh1FzGf8wSmVnIsfLekiMBuiOk=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/LiGCCCf1XYNYNAkdLgh1FzGf8wSmVnIsfLekiMBuiOk=.webp)\n\n\n* **Database**\n\n\n  * Easily create, organize, and track your data like never before.
