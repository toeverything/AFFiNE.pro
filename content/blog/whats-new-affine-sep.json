Here's a breakdown of the most exciting changes:\n\n\n\n\n\n### Frame & Group Enhancements\n\n\nWe've made improvements to the Frame & Group feature, enhancing the feedback you receive when dragging elements into a Frame or selecting them. The Frame label is now less intrusive, allowing for more fluid organization, while the Group feature has a refreshed look, making hierarchy logic clearer for better content organization.\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOqB-A-PEDU\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n### Page Info: Created & Edited By\n\n\nIn this update, we now support tracking the creator and updater of pages at the workspace level. This feature makes collaboration more transparent, letting you easily identify who has been involved in creating or editing content. You can find this new functionality in the workspace property settings.\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Yr6AkUqyaU\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n### \n\n\n### Block Reference: Link to Block\n\n\nOne of the most requested features, the Link to Block functionality, is now available! You can now reference specific blocks within your pages or in Edgeless Mode. Simply copy the link to any block and paste it elsewhere in AFFiNE for precise navigation between sections. This feature is perfect for creating deep interconnections in your workspace.\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBptiEGsLT8\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n### LaTeX Support\n\n\nLaTeX is here! You can now insert formulas into your documents using LaTeX code. We support both inline and display LaTeX, making typesetting easier for those working with mathematical or scientific content. Insert LaTeX via theSlash menu or using shortcuts like `$$` for inline equations and `$$$$` for display LaTeX.\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YL-TzIF83Q\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n### \n\n\n### Sharing & Duplicating Enhancements\n\n\nSharing in AFFiNE has become even more flexible. You can now share specific parts of your document, whether it's a page, a view, or even a specific block. Public sharing is now simpler—once you've shared a link, it remains valid until you turn off access. We've also added URL Preview Support, so when you share a public link on platforms like Slack, the title and description will reflect the document content. Inline links now work correctly in sharing mode as well!\n\n\n\n![D8JyhoaM7ojXINV_4Kju7EJFk9NxECnk0mcz0jNi9Xg=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/qf73AF6vzWphbTJdN7KiX/blobs/D8JyhoaM7ojXINV_4Kju7EJFk9NxECnk0mcz0jNi9Xg=)\n\n\n### \n\n\n### Editor Settings Customization\n\n\nYou can now make AFFiNE’s editor fit your style and preferences! Customize various settings and persist them across sessions. If you're using AFFiNE Cloud, your settings will sync automatically. For CJK users, we've added support for custom fonts to improve the display of text, ensuring your documents look exactly how you want.\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_290ZgCYTTs\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_290ZgCYTTs\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n### Mind Map 2.0: Mind Map Optimizations\n\n\nWe’ve added the ability to import mind maps from `.freemind` and `.opml` files, making it easier to integrate your existing work into AFFiNE. We’ve also introduced a new connector feature, based on community feedback, allowing for direct connections between mind map sub-nodes. Layout improvements and better keyboard shortcut support have also been added to make mind maps more intuitive and easier to use.\n\n\n<iframe\n  type=\"text/html\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"410px\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nr7i0rYgWFo\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n  allowfullscreen\n  credentialless>\n</iframe>\n\n\n### \n\n\n### Templates: Boost Your Productivity\n\n\nTake advantage of our new templates to amplify your creativity!
